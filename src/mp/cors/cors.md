# Overview

The [cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors) helps developers control if and
how REST resources served by their applications can be shared across
origins. Helidon MP includes an implementation of CORS that you can use
to add CORS behavior to the services you develop. You can define your
application’s CORS behavior programmatically using the Helidon CORS API
alone or together with configuration.

Helidon also provides three built-in services that add their own
endpoints to your application, health, metrics, and OpenAPI, that have
integrated CORS support. By adding very little code to your application,
you control how all the resources in your application, the ones you write
and the ones provided by the Helidon built-in services, can be shared
across origins.

## Before You Begin

Before you revise your application to add CORS support, you need to
decide what type of cross-origin sharing you want to allow for each
resource your application exposes. For example, suppose for a given
resource you want to allow unrestricted sharing for GET, HEAD, and POST
requests (what CORS refers to as "simple" requests), but permit other
types of requests only from the two origins `foo.com` and `there.com`.
Your application would implement two types of CORS sharing: more relaxed
for the simple requests and stricter for others.

Once you know the type of sharing you want to allow for each of your
resources, including any from built-in services, you can change your
application accordingly.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable CORS, add the following dependency to your project’s `pom.xml`
(see [Managing Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-cors</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

Once you have planned how each of your resources should support CORS,
you specify the CORS behavior in one of two ways:

- add `@CrossOrigin` annotations to the Java code for the resources, or

- add configuration.

You can do both. CORS configuration for a resource overrides any CORS
settings declared using `@CrossOrigin` in the Java class for the
resource.

# API

## The `@CrossOrigin` Annotation

Adding CORS behavior to your Helidon MP application involves just a few
simple steps.

For each resource class in your application:

1.  Identify the resources and sub-resources, in other words, the
    paths, declared in the resource class which you want to support CORS.

2.  For each of those resources and sub-resources which should support
    CORS:

    1.  Find or create a Java method annotated with `@OPTIONS` and with
        the correct `@Path`.

    2.  To that `@OPTIONS` Java method add a Helidon
        [`@CrossOrigin`](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.microprofile.cors/io/helidon/microprofile/cors/CrossOrigin.html)
        annotation that describes the cross-origin sharing you want for
        that resource.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the `@CrossOrigin` annotation *only* on methods which also have
> the `@OPTIONS` annotation. Remember that the `@CrossOrigin` settings
> apply to a given path and therefore to all Java resource methods which
> share that path.
>
> Helidon MP aborts the server start-up if you use the `@CrossOrigin`
> annotation on a resource method other than an `@OPTIONS` method.
>
> For an informal look at the reasons for applying the `@CrossOrigin`
> annotation to the `@OPTIONS` method, instead of another method, see
> [Why
> `@OPTIONS`?](../../mp/cors/why-options.md).

The [configuration table](#config-table) below describes the attributes
of the `@CrossOrigin` annotation.

# Configuration

You can define CORS behavior, and you or your users can override behavior
declared in your code, using configuration.

For each resource you want to configure, add a section to
`META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file:

General form of CORS configuration:
```properties
cors.enabled= 
cors.paths.i.path-pattern=
cors.paths.i.allow-headers=
cors.paths.i.max-age-seconds=
cors.paths.i.allow-credentials=
cors.paths.i.allow-origins=
cors.paths.i.expose-headers=
cors.paths.i.allow-methods=
cors.paths.i.enabled= 
```

- You can disable CORS processing for all resources by setting
  `cors.enabled` to `false`. Defaults to `true`.

- Add a block for each resource you want to configure. The index `i` is
  an integer (0, 1, 2, etc).

- Specify the settings as needed to define the CORS behavior you want
  for that resource.

- The `enabled` setting lets you control whether the system uses that
  set of CORS configuration. Defaults to `true`.

The system uses the index `i`, not the position in the config file, to
identify the settings for a particular resource.

Path patterns can be any expression accepted by the
[`PathMatcher`](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.http/io/helidon/http/PathMatcher.html)
class.

> [!NOTE]
> Helidon scans the cross-origin entries in index order (0, 1, 2, etc.)
> until it finds an entry that matches an incoming request’s path and
> HTTP method, so be sure to assign index values to the entries so
> Helidon will check them in the order you want. In particular, use
> lower index values for entries with more specific path patterns.

The table below describes the attributes on the `@CrossOrigin`
annotation and the configuration keys that map to the headers defined in
the CORS protocol.

| annotation attribute | config key          | type       | default | description                                        | CORS header name                   |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `allowCredentials`   | `allow-credentials` | boolean    | `false` | Sets the allow credentials flag.                   | `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` |
| `allowHeaders`       | `allow-headers`     | string\[\] | `*`     | Sets the allowed headers.                          | `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`     |
| `allowMethods`       | `allow-methods`     | string\[\] | `*`     | Sets the allowed methods.                          | `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`     |
| `allowOrigins`       | `allow-origins`     | string\[\] | `*`     | Sets the allowed origins.                          | `Access-Control-Allow-Origins`     |
| `exposeHeaders`      | `expose-headers`    | string\[\] |         | Sets the expose headers.                           | `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`    |
| `maxAgeSeconds`      | `max-age-seconds`   | long       | `3600`  | Sets the maximum age.                              | `Access-Control-Max-Age`           |
| `enabled`            | `enabled`           | boolean    | `true`  | Sets whether this config should be enabled or not. | n/a                                |

If the cross-origin configuration is disabled (`enabled` = false), then
the Helidon CORS implementation ignores the cross-origin configuration
entry.

# Examples

The [Helidon MP Quickstart application](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-examples/tree/helidon-4.x/examples/quickstarts/helidon-quickstart-mp) allows users to:

- obtain greetings by sending `GET` requests to the `/greet` resource,
  and

- change the greeting message by sending a `PUT` request to the
  `/greet/greeting` resource.

The [Helidon MP CORS Example](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-examples/tree/helidon-4.x/examples/microprofile/cors)
shows the basic quickstart example enhanced for CORS.

The discussion below describes the changes in the application which:

- permit unrestricted sharing of the resource `/greet`, and

- restrict sharing of the resource `/greet/greeting` so that only the
  origins `http://foo.com` and `http://there.com` can change the
  greeting.

## Adding Annotations

Using annotations to declare CORS behavior:
```java
@Path("/greet")
public class GreetResource { 

    @GET
    public JsonObject getDefaultMessage() { 
        return Json.createObjectBuilder()
                .add("message", "Hello")
                .build();
    }

    @Path("/greeting")
    @PUT
    public Response updateGreeting(JsonObject jsonObject) { 
        return Response.ok().build();
    }

    @OPTIONS
    @CrossOrigin()
    public void optionsForRetrievingUnnamedGreeting() { 
    }

    @OPTIONS
    @Path("/greeting")
    @CrossOrigin(value = {"http://foo.com", "http://there.com"},
                 allowMethods = {HttpMethod.PUT})
    public void optionsForUpdatingGreeting() { 
    }
}
```

- Existing `GreetResource` resource class with path `/greet`.

- Existing `@GET` method for resource `/greet`.

- Existing `@PUT` method for resource `/greet/greeting`.

- New `@OPTIONS` method for `/greet`. (Just like the `@GET` method
  `getDefaultMessage`, this `@OPTIONS` method does not have a `@Path`
  annotation; both "inherit" the class-level `@Path` setting `/greet`.)
  The `@CrossOrigin` annotation declares default cross-origin sharing
  which permits sharing via all HTTP methods to all origins.

- New `@OPTIONS` method for `/greet/greeting`. The `@CrossOrigin`
  annotation specifies sharing only via the `PUT` HTTP method and only
  to the two listed origins.

## Adding Configuration

You could use the following configuration in place of using annotations
to set up the same CORS behavior.

Using configuration to set up the same CORS behavior:
```properties
cors.paths.0.path-pattern=/greet 

cors.paths.1.path-pattern=/greet/greeting 
cors.paths.1.allow-origins=https://foo.com,https://there.com
cors.paths.1.allow-methods=PUT
```

- Enables default CORS settings for the `/greet` resource.

- Sets up sharing for the `/greet/greeting` resource only via `PUT`
  requests and only from the specified origins.

Or, alternatively, the following configuration example augments the
settings from the `@CrossOrigin` annotations in the code.

Using configuration to augment or override declared CORS behavior:
```properties
cors.paths.0.path-pattern=/greet 
cors.paths.0.allow-methods=GET
cors.paths.0.allow-origins=https://here.com,https://foo.com,https://there.com

cors.paths.1.path-pattern=/greet/greeting 
cors.paths.1.allow-methods=PUT
cors.paths.1.allow-origins=https://foo.com
```

- Changes the declared settings to restrict cross-origin use of `/greet`
  to only `GET` and only from `foo.com` and `there.com`.

- Changes the settings for `/greet/greeting` from what they were
  declared; with this configuration, only the origin `foo.com` is
  permitted. (The declared setting also allowed `there.com`).

# Additional Information

## CORS and the Requested URI Feature

The decisions the Helidon CORS feature makes depend on accurate
information about each incoming request, particularly the host to which
the request is sent. Conveyed as headers in the request, this
information can be changed or overwritten by intermediate nodes, such as
load balancers, between the origin of the request and your service.

Well-behaved intermediate nodes preserve this important data in other
headers, such as `Forwarded`. You can configure how the Helidon server
handles these headers as described in the documentation for [requested
URI
discovery](../../mp/server.md#using-requested-uri-discovery).

The CORS support in Helidon uses the requested URI feature to discover
the correct information about each request, according to your
configuration, so it can make accurate decisions about whether to permit
cross-origin accesses.

## Using CORS Support in Built-in Helidon Services

Several built-in Helidon
services, [health](../../mp/health.md),
[metrics](../../mp/metrics/metrics.md),
and
[OpenAPI](../../mp/openapi/openapi.md)--have
integrated CORS support. You can include these services in your
application and control how those resources can be shared across
origins.

For example, several websites related to OpenAPI run a web application
in your browser. You provide the URL for your application to the browser
application. The browser application uses the URL to retrieve the
OpenAPI document that describes the application’s endpoints directly
from your application. The browser application then displays a user
interface that you use to "drive" your application. That is, you provide
input, have the web application send requests to your application
endpoints, and then view the responses. This scenario is exactly the
situation CORS addresses: an application in the browser from one
origin, the user interface downloaded from the website, requests a
resource from another origin, the `/openapi` endpoint which Helidon’s
OpenAPI built-in service automatically adds to your application.

Integrating CORS support into these built-in services allows such
third-party websites and their browser applications, or more
generally, apps from any other origin, to work with your Helidon
application.

Because all three of these built-in Helidon services serve primarily
`GET` endpoints, by default the integrated CORS support in all three
services permits any origin to share their resources using `GET`,
`HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` HTTP requests. You can customize the CORS set-up
for these built-in services independently from each other using
configuration. You can use this override feature to control the CORS
behavior of the built-in services even if you do not add CORS behavior
to your own endpoints.

### Built-in Services with CORS

To use built-in services with CORS support and customize the CORS
behavior:

1.  Add the built-in service or services to your application.

2.  Add a dependency on the
    `io.helidon.webserver:helidon-webserver-cors` CORS artifact to your
    Maven `pom.xml` file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want the built-in services to support CORS, then you need
    > to add the CORS dependency even if your own endpoints do not use
    > CORS.

3.  Use configuration to set up the CORS behavior by path as needed.

The documentation for the individual built-in services describes how to
add each service to your application, including adding a Maven
dependency for the built-in feature.

### Configuring CORS for Built-in Services

Use configuration to control whether and how each of the built-in
services works with CORS.

In the `cors` configuration section add a block for each built-in
service using its path as described in the CORS configuration section.

The following example restricts sharing of

- the `/health` resource, provided by the health built-in service, to
  only the origin `https://there.com`, and

- the `/metrics` resource, provided by the metrics built-in service, to
  only the origin `https://foo.com`.

Configuration which restricts sharing of the health and metrics
resources:
```properties
cors.paths.0.path-pattern=/health
cors.paths.0.allow-origins=https://there.com
cors.paths.1.path-pattern=/metrics
cors.paths.1.allow-origins=https://foo.com
```

### Accessing the Shared Resources

If you have edited the Helidon MP QuickStart application as described in
the previous topics and saved your changes, you can build and run the
application. Once you do so you can execute `curl` commands to
demonstrate the behavior changes in the metric and health services with
the addition of the CORS functionality. Note the addition of the
`Origin` header value in the `curl` commands, and the
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the successful responses.

#### Build and Run the Application

Build and run the QuickStart application as usual.

```shell
mvn package
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-mp.jar
```

Console output:
```text
2020.05.12 05:44:08 INFO io.helidon.microprofile.server.ServerCdiExtension Thread[main,5,main]: Server started on http://localhost:8080 (and all other host addresses) in 5280 milliseconds (since JVM startup).
```

#### Retrieve Metrics

The metrics service rejects attempts to access metrics on behalf of a
disallowed origin.

```shell
curl -i -H "Origin: https://other.com" http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

Curl output:
```text
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Date: Mon, 11 May 2020 11:08:09 -0500
transfer-encoding: chunked
connection: keep-alive
```

But accesses from `foo.com` succeed.

```shell
curl -i -H "Origin: https://foo.com" http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

Curl output:
```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.com
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Mon, 11 May 2020 11:08:16 -0500
Vary: Origin
connection: keep-alive
content-length: 6065

# TYPE base_classloader_loadedClasses_count gauge
# HELP base_classloader_loadedClasses_count Displays the number of classes that are currently loaded in the Java virtual machine.
base_classloader_loadedClasses_count 3568
```

#### Retrieve Health

The health service rejects requests from origins not specifically
approved.

```shell
curl -i -H "Origin: https://foo.com" http://localhost:8080/health
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Date: Mon, 11 May 2020 12:06:55 -0500
transfer-encoding: chunked
connection: keep-alive
```

And responds successfully only to cross-origin requests from
`https://there.com`.

```shell
curl -i -H "Origin: https://there.com" http://localhost:8080/health
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://there.com
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 11 May 2020 12:07:32 -0500
Vary: Origin
connection: keep-alive
content-length: 461

{"outcome":"UP",...}
```
