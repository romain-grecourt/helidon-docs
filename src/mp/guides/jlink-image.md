This guide describes how to build a custom runtime image for your
Helidon application using Helidon’s support for the JDK’s `jlink` tool.

# Introduction

JDK 9 introduced the
[`jlink`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/jlink.html)
command that supports assembling a set of modules and their dependencies
into a custom runtime image. The `helidon-maven-plugin` has support for
easily creating a custom runtime image for your Helidon application
resulting in a smaller, better performing runtime.

In this guide you will learn how to build a custom runtime image locally
on your machine, as well as how to build it in a Docker image.

Prerequisite product versions for Helidon 4.4.0-SNAPSHOT

Verify Prerequisites:

```shell
java -version
mvn --version
docker --version
kubectl version
```

Setting JAVA_HOME:
```shell
# On Mac
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21`

# On Linux
# Use the appropriate path to your JDK
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-21
```

# Verify JDK

As noted in the prerequisites above, Java 21 or newer is required (Java
25 or newer is recommended).

```shell
$JAVA_HOME/bin/java --version
```

Creating a custom runtime image requires that the JDK modules are
present as `*.jmod` files, and some distributions do not provide them by
default. Check the `jmods` directory to ensure they are present:

```shell
ls $JAVA_HOME/jmods
```

> [!TIP]
> [RPM
> based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#RPM-based)
> distributions provide `*.jmod` files in separate
> `java-*-openjdk-jmods` packages. [Debian
> based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based)
> distributions provide `*.jmod` files only in the
> `openjdk-*-jdk-headless` packages.

# Generate the Project

Generate the project using the Helidon MP Quickstart Maven archetype.

```shell
mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -DarchetypeVersion=4.4.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.examples \
    -DartifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp
```

The archetype generates a Maven project in your current directory (for
example, `helidon-quickstart-mp`). Change into this directory and build.

```shell
cd helidon-quickstart-mp
mvn package
```

At this point you can run the application using the JVM:

```shell
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-mp.jar
```

In another shell, test an endpoint:

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
```

The application should respond with `{"message":"Hello World!"}`

Now stop the running application (by pressing Ctrl+C).

For more information about the Quickstart application and other
endpoints it supports see the [Helidon MP quickstart
Guide](../../mp/guides/quickstart.md).

# Building a Custom Runtime Image

You can build a custom runtime image in 2 different ways:

- Locally, on your desktop

- Using Docker

## Local Build

Build the custom runtime image using the jlink image profile:

```shell
mvn package -Pjlink-image
```

> [!TIP]
> This uses the `helidon-maven-plugin` to perform the custom image
> generation.

After the build completes it will report some statistics about the build
including the reduction in image size.

The `target/helidon-quickstart-mp-jri` directory is a self-contained
custom image of your application. It contains your application, its
runtime dependencies and the JDK modules it depends on. You can start
your application using the provide `start` script:

```shell
./target/helidon-quickstart-mp-jri/bin/start
```

## Class Data Sharing (CDS) Archive

Also included in the custom image is a Class Data Sharing (CDS) archive
that improves your application’s startup performance and in-memory
footprint. You can learn more about Class Data Sharing in the [JDK
documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/vm/class-data-sharing.html).

The CDS archive increases your image size to get these performance
optimizations. It can be of significant size (tens of MB). The size of
the CDS archive is reported at the end of the build output.

If you’d rather have a smaller image size (with a slightly increased
startup time) you can skip the creation of the CDS archive by executing
your build like this:

```shell
mvn package -Pjlink-image -Djlink.image.addClassDataSharingArchive=false
```

For more information on available configuration options see the
[`helidon-maven-plugin` documentation](https://github.com/oracle/helidon-build-tools/blob/3.0.5/maven-plugins/helidon-maven-plugin/README.md#goal-jlink-image).

## Multi-Stage Docker Build

To build a Docker image with a custom Java runtime image use the jlink
Dockerfile included with the quickstart.

```shell
docker build -t helidon-quickstart-mp-jri -f Dockerfile.jlink .
```

> [!TIP]
> This does a full build inside the Docker container. The first time you
> run it, it will take a while because it is downloading all the
> Maven dependencies and caching them in a Docker layer. Subsequent
> builds will be much faster as long as you don’t change the `pom.xml`
> file. If the pom is modified then the dependencies will be
> re-downloaded.

Start the application:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 helidon-quickstart-mp-jri:latest
```

You can exercise the application’s endpoints as before.

# Using Custom Runtime Images

Custom runtime images are ideal for use when you want all the runtime
performance of the JDK JVM in a reasonably compact form.

For cases where absolute minimal startup time and image size are
required, then consider using [GraalVM Native Images](../../mp/guides/graalnative.md).
