This guide describes the basic process of deploying a Helidon MP
application on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

# Overview

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a set of complementary cloud
services that enable you to build and run a range of applications and
services in a highly available hosted environment. For an overview of
OCI features, see [Welcome to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Concepts/baremetalintro.htm)
in OCI documentation.

The Helidon MP OCI Project Starter intended to quickly create a Helidon
project for deployment on OCI. It is currently only available with
Helidon MP, but you can write Helidon SE applications directly with the
[OCI SDK for Java APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/javasdk.htm)
and use this guide as a guideline for setting up your OCI environment.

By deploying Helidon applications on OCI, you can take advantage of OCI
services and features. Helidon integration with OCI includes support for
the [OCI SDK for Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/javasdk.htm) -
allowing you to write custom code to extend features.

Helidon also provides a [Helidon OCI SDK CDI portable extension](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0.html#spi)
to support injecting [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDK Clients](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/javasdk.htm)
in your Helidon application. See [OCI Integration](../integrations/oci.md).

This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge and familiarity with
OCI. If you already have an OCI environment set up and running, you can
consult the [Deploying a Helidon OCI MP Application on a Basic OCI Setup](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-labs/blob/main/hols/oci-basic-setup/README.md)
lab in the Helidon Labs GitHub repository for the requirements of
configuring and running the server service.

kubectl version
```

Setting JAVA_HOME:
```shell
# On Mac
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21`

# On Linux
# Use the appropriate path to your JDK
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-21
```

# Generating the Project

You can generate Helidon MP project files for OCI using the Helidon
Project Starter.

A Helidon Project Starter allows you to choose from a set of archetypes
with pre-defined feature sets and lets you customize it by providing a
host of options.

1.  Go to the [Helidon Project Starter](https://helidon.io/starter) page
    on the Helidon website.

2.  Under **Helidon Flavor**, select **Helidon MP** and click **Next**.

3.  Under **Application Type**, select **OCI** and click **Next**.

4.  If you are using this application for testing or development
    purposes, then under **Customize Project**, leave the values as
    default and go to the next step. If you want to use the generated
    project as the basis for a production application, then replace
    `groupId`, `artifactId` and `package` with values appropriate for
    your application.

5.  Click **Download** to save the project zip archive to your computer.

6.  Extract the project files.

You can also use the Helidon CLI to generate the Helidon MP OCI project
instead.

The Helidon MP OCI project is pre-configured to integrate with several
common OCI services, but you must update its configuration with values
specific to your application and OCI environment. To learn more about
the components of Helidon MP OCI Starter Project, see `/README.md` and
`/server/README.md`, included in the starter project.

The project contains both server and client services that leverage
OpenAPI to demonstrate an API-first development approach. Both services
generate API source codes using the [OpenAPI java-helidon-server
Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/java-helidon-server/)
and [OpenAPI java-helidon-client
Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/java-helidon-client/),
along with the [OpenAPI 3.0
Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0).

It should be noted that the project is limited to implementing the
business logic of the generated Server API code.

For more information on Helidon OpenAPI support, see the [MicroProfile OpenAPI specification](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-3.1.1/microprofile-openapi-spec-3.1.1.html).

The server service also allows you to build, configure and test the
application locally.

The Helidon MP OCI Starter Project also includes Helidon’s built-in
liveness and readiness health checks which allow you to expose the
project’s health status to external tools.

See [MicroProfile Health](../health.md) for general information on the Health Check
feature and then read the **Health Checks** section in
`/server/README.md` for how it’s implemented in this project.

# Running the Application Locally

Use the project to build an application jar for the example. It saves
all runtime dependencies in the `/target/libs` directory, allowing you
to easily start the application by running the application jar file.

1.  Change to the directory containing the project files and run:

Build the Application:
```shell
mvn package
```
1.  Then, to run the application, run:

Run the application:
```shell
java -jar server/target/myproject-server.jar
```

The example is a very simple "Hello World" greeting service. It supports
GET requests for generating a greeting message, and a PUT request for
changing the greeting itself. The response is encoded using JSON.

Try the Application:
```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
{"message":"Hello World!"}

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Joe
{"message":"Hello Joe!"}

curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"greeting" : "Hola"}' http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Jose
{"message":"Hola Jose!"}
```

# Deploying a Helidon Application on OCI

You can deploy a Helidon application to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
(OCI) environment, using either OCI Compute or OCI Kubernetes Engine
(OKE). Depending on your requirements, one option might be better suited
to your needs than the other.

- **OCI Compute** lets you provision and manage Compute hosts, known as
  instances, to run your applications. Instances can be either bare
  metal or virtual machines (VM). See
  [Compute](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/home.htm)
  in OCI documentation for more information.

- **OKE** is a fully-managed, scalable, and highly available service
  that you can use to deploy your containerized applications to the
  cloud. See [Kubernetes Engine](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/home.htm)
  in OCI documentation for more information.

After you have selected your OCI environment, you can get started with
deploying your Helidon applications.

- To learn how to deploy a Helidon MP application on **OCI Compute**,
  follow the instructions outlined at [Deploying a Helidon OCI MP
  Application on a Basic OCI
  Setup](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-labs/blob/main/hols/oci-basic-setup/README.md)
  in the Helidon Labs GitHub repository.

- To learn how to deploy a Helidon MP application on **OCI OKE**, follow
  the instructions outlined at [Kubernetes: Deploy a Java Helidon Application](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/helidon-k8s/01oci-helidon-k8s-summary.htm)
  in OCI documentation. Make sure you select **OCI** as the Application
  Type, and *not* Quickstart.

If you already have an OCI environment, you can deploy the application
there instead of setting up a new environment. At minimum, you must
configure the following OCI resources to deploy a Helidon application:

- **Compartment**: to organize the OCI resources required for the
  Helidon project.

- **Dynamic Group**: to group the Compute instances as principal actors
  required to grant access certain OCI resources using OCI policies.

- **Policies**: to provide access to some OCI resources for Compute
  instances defined in the OCI Dynamic Group. This project requires
  access to the Logging and Metrics resources. For example:

      ----
      Allow dynamic-group <My_Dynamic_Group> to use log-content in compartment <My_Compartment>
      Allow dynamic-group <My_Dynamic_Group> to use metrics in compartment <My_Compartment>
      ---

- **Compute Instance**: to host the deployed application. Open port
  `8080` in the firewall. The Helidon application is accessed from port
  `8080`.

- **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)**: With a `Security List` that contains
  an ingress security rule that opens port `8080`. The Helidon
  application is accessed from port `8080`.

- **Log and Log Group Resources**: if you plan on using the Custom Logs
  service.

## Integrating with OCI Services

Before you can use OCI services, you must properly configure your
application to run on OCI. The Helidon MP OCI Project Starter is already
partially configured to integrate with several common OCI services, but
you must update its configuration with values specific to your
application and OCI environment.

The Helidon OCI SDK extension also supports injecting clients for any
[OCI services supported by the OCI SDK for Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/javasdk.htm#Services_Supported).
See [OCI Integration](../integrations/oci.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Whenever you integrate a new OCI service in your application, you must
> build and redeploy the application to enable the feature of that OCI
> service.

The [Deploying a Helidon OCI MP Application on a Basic OCI Setup](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-labs/blob/main/hols/oci-basic-setup/README.md)
lab in the Helidon Labs GitHub repository includes a
`update_config_values.sh` script , which updates the necessary values
required to set up OCI Monitoring and OCI Logging. You can also read the
applicable sections in `/server/README.md` for instructions.

### Helidon MP Metrics to OCI Monitoring

The OCI Monitoring services allows you to actively and passively monitor
cloud resources using the Metrics and Alarms features.

Use OCI Monitoring with your Helidon MP application to amass an
abundance of valuable server and application insight and place it
directly into OCI Monitoring where it can be analyzed as needed. For an
overview of OCI Monitoring features, see
[Monitoring](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm)
in OCI documentation.

To learn how to send Helidon MP metrics to OCI Monitoring, read the
**Helidon MP Metrics to OCI Monitoring** section in `/server/README.md`.

### Logging

The OCI Logging service is a highly scalable and fully managed single
pane of glass for the logs in your tenancy. For an overview of
the OCI Logging feature, see [Logging Overview](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Logging/Concepts/loggingoverview.htm) in OCI documentation.

Helidon uses the [custom logs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Logging/Concepts/custom_logs.htm)
feature of OCI Logging for integration. The ability to add custom logs
from any OCI Compute instance makes it more flexible to use this feature
with other components such as Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE).

To learn how to enable OCI Logging integration, read the **Custom Logs
Monitoring** section in `/server/README.md`.

# Working with Other OCI Services

While the Helidon MP OCI Starter Project focuses on the OCI Monitoring
and OCI Logging services, you can extend the project to use other OCI
services, as demonstrated by the examples below.

## Streaming

The OCI Streaming service provides a fully managed, scalable, and
durable solution for ingesting and consuming high-volume data streams in
real time. See
[Streaming](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Streaming/Concepts/streamingoverview.htm)
in OCI documentation.

The OCI Streaming service is compatible with Apache Kafka clients which
means that when your Helidon applications are deployed in OCI
environments, you can use either the OCI Streaming service or Apache
Kafka. See [Using Streaming with Apache Kafka](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Streaming/Tasks/kafkacompatibility.htm)
in OCI documentation.

Streams are organized into logical groups called Stream Pools. When you
connect to OCI Streaming with a Kafka client, streams are handled as
Kafka topics and stream pools as virtual Kafka clusters.

To enable OCI Streaming integration, first you need to create a new
stream in OCI. For instructions, see [Creating a Stream](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Streaming/Tasks/creatingstreamsandstreampools_create-stream.htm)
in OCI documentation.

After you have finished creating the stream, make a note of the
following values:

- Stream name (on the Stream Details page)

- Messages endpoint (on the Stream Details page)

- OCID of the stream *pool* (on the Stream Pool Details page)

You can also click Kafka Connection Settings (on the Stream Pool Details
page) to see an example of Kafka connection settings.

Next, add the following dependency to your project’s `pom.xml`:

Adding the dependency for OCI Streaming:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.messaging</groupId>
  <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-messaging</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.helidon.messaging.kafka</groupId>
  <artifactId>helidon-messaging-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Next, update `/server/src/main/resources/application.yaml` with
streaming connection properties:

Example of an `application.yaml` configured for OCI Streaming:
```yaml
oci:
 tenant: helidon-app-example 
 user: email@domain.com 
 token: oci-auth-token 
 test-stream: 
   name: TestStream
   endpoint: cell-1.streaming.us-phoenix-1.oci.oraclecloud.com
   port: 9092
   streampool-ocid: ocid1.streampool.oci1.phoenix.amaaaaaamevwycaap72ouurhfjrakuccakjpse5kenpkm5oikbgaadtq6byq
```

- The name of the OCI tenancy.
- The OCI account user name.
- The OCI authentication token. See [Getting an Auth Token](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/registrygettingauthtoken.htm) in OCI documentation.
- The details of the stream which you saved earlier. The `port` should
  be the standard Kafka port number `9092`.

Then, still in `/server/src/main/resources/application.yaml`, configure
messaging channels to use Helidon’s Kafka connector.

Example of a configuration for the helidon-kafka connector:
```yaml
mp.messaging:

  incoming.from-stream:
    connector: helidon-kafka
    topic: TestStream 
    auto.offset.reset: latest
    enable.auto.commit: true
    group.id: example-group-id 

  outgoing.to-stream:
    connector: helidon-kafka
    topic: TestStream 

  connector:
     helidon-kafka:
       bootstrap.servers: ocid1.streampool.oci1.phoenix.amaaaaaamevwycaap72ouurhfjrakuccakjpse5kenpkm5oikbgaadtq6byq:9092 
       sasl.mechanism: PLAIN
       security.protocol: SASL_SSL
       sasl.jaas.config:  >-
         org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule
         required
         username="helidon-app-example/person@domain.com/ocid1.streampool.oci1.phoenix.amaaaaaamevwycaap72ouurhfjrakuccakjpse5kenpkm5oikbgaadtq6byq" 
         password="oci-auth-token"; 

       key.serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
       value.serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
       key.deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
       value.deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
```

- The OCI stream name (which should match the value that you defined
  earlier in application.yaml).

- The ID for the stream group

- Kafka client’s property
  [`bootstrap.servers`](https://kafka.apache.org/28/documentation.html#consumerconfigs_bootstrap.servers)
  configuration for all channels using the connector, using the
  following structure
  `<oci.test-stream.endpoint>:<oci.test-stream.port>`.

- A username in this structure:
  `<oci.tenant>/<oci.user>/<oci.test-stream.streampool-ocid>`.

- The OCI authentication token.

After you configure the `helidon-kafka` connector, you can use it on
messaging channels to integrate with the OCI Streaming service.

## Tracing

The OCI Application Performance Monitoring (APM) service provides deep
visibility into the performance of applications and provides the ability
to diagnose issues quickly in order to deliver a consistent level of
service. See [About APM](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/application-performance-monitoring.html) in OCI documentation.

Use OCI APM with Helidon to trace requests from start to finish,
allowing you to analyze requests across your distributed services and
thereby obtain a complete picture to identify bottlenecks and issues
early on.

To enable OCI Tracing integration, start by creating an APM Domain, an
OCI resource that contains the systems being monitored by APM. See
[Create an APM Domain](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/create-apm-domain.html#GUID-ABC79A90-3940-4360-9E21-57D25B86F92B) in OCI documentation.

Make sure that you record the **Data Upload Endpoint** and **Data Keys**
for the APM domain - you will need them to configure the APM Java Tracer
on the application. If you need to find them again, follow the steps at
[Obtain Data Upload Endpoint and Data  Keys](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/obtain-data-upload-endpoint-and-data-keys.html) in OCI documentation.

Next, configure the APM Java Tracer to use with Helidon. The APM Java
Tracer (or just APM Tracer) is an APM data source that gathers and
uploads data such as metrics and spans for monitoring. See [Use APM Tracer in  Helidon](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/use-apm-tracer-helidon.html)
in OCI documentation.

After you configure OCI APM with Helidon, you can use OCI Trace Explorer
to view traces and spans and identify performance issues in your
monitored application. See [Monitor Traces in Trace  Explorer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/monitor-traces-trace-explorer.html#GUID-D23BCE18-F42F-44A1-B583-47DF9F9817D8)
in OCI documentation.

> [!TIP]
> You can use OpenTelemetry for tracing and then ship the traces to OCI
> APM. Read the [Distributed Tracing in Helidon, Coherence and Oracle
> Autonomous Database with OpenTelemetry and OCI
> APM](https://medium.com/oracledevs/distributed-tracing-in-helidon-coherence-and-oracle-autonomous-database-with-opentelemetry-and-c60fe965f902)
> article on Medium.
