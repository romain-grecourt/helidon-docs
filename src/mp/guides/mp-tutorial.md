This tutorial describes how to build a Helidon MicroProfile (MP)
application from scratch including JSON REST endpoints, metrics, health
check, and configuration.

Setting JAVA_HOME:
```shell
# On Mac
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21`

# On Linux
# Use the appropriate path to your JDK
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-21
```

# Create the Maven Project

This tutorial demonstrates how to create the application from scratch,
without using the Maven archetypes as a quickstart.

Create a new empty directory for the project (for example,
`helidon-mp-tutorial`). Change into this directory.

Create a new Maven POM file (called `pom.xml`) and add the following
content:

Initial Maven POM file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

        <groupId>io.helidon.applications</groupId>
        <artifactId>helidon-mp</artifactId>
        <version>4.4.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <relativePath/>
    </parent>

    <groupId>io.helidon.examples</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-mp-tutorial</artifactId>
    <name>${project.artifactId}</name>

    <properties>
        <mainClass>io.helidon.examples.Main</mainClass>
    </properties>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.bundles</groupId>
            <artifactId>helidon-microprofile</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>copy-libs</id>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
                <artifactId>jandex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>make-index</id>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

The POM file contains the basic project information and configurations
needed to get started and does the following:

- Includes the Helidon MP application parent pom. This parent pom
  contains dependency and plugin management to keep your application’s
  pom simple and clean.

- Establishes the Maven coordinates for the new project.

- Sets the `mainClass` which will be used later when building a JAR
  file. The class will be created later in this tutorial.

- Adds a dependency for the MicroProfile bundle which allows the use of
  MicroProfile features in the application. The helidon-mp parent pom
  includes dependency management, so you don’t need to include a version
  number here. You will automatically use the version of Helidon that
  matches the version of the parent pom (4.4.0-SNAPSHOT in this case).

- Adds plugins to be executed during the build. The
  `maven-dependency-plugin` is used to copy the runtime dependencies
  into your target directory. The `jandex-maven-plugin` builds an index
  of your class files for faster loading. The Helidon parent pom handles
  the details of configuring these plugins. But you can modify the
  configuration here.

> [!TIP]
> MicroProfile contains features like Metrics, Health Check, Streams
> Operators, Open Tracing, OpenAPI, REST client, and fault tolerance.
> You can find detailed information about MicroProfile on the [Eclipse
 MicroProfile](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile)
> site.

With this `pom.xml`, the application can be built successfully with
Maven:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

This will create a JAR file in the `target` directory.

> [!TIP]
> The warning message
> `JAR will be empty - no content was marked for inclusion!` can be
> ignored for now because there is no actual content in the application
> yet.

# Start Implementing the MicroProfile Application

The actual application logic can be created now. Create a directory for
your source code, and then create directories for the package hierarchy:

Create directories for source code:

```shell
mkdir -p src/main/java/io/helidon/examples
```

The application will be a simple REST service that will return a
greeting to the caller. The first iteration of the application will
contain a resource class and a Main class which will be used to start up
the Helidon server and the application.

> [!TIP]
> Technically, your own main class is not needed unless you want to
> control the startup sequence. You can set the `mainClass` property to
> `io.helidon.microprofile.cdi.Main` and it will use Helidon’s default
> main class.

The `GreetResource` is defined in the `GreetResource.java` class as shown below:
```java
@Path("/greet")
@RequestScoped
public class GreetResource {

    private static final JsonBuilderFactory JSON = Json.createBuilderFactory(Map.of());

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public JsonObject getDefaultMessage() {
        return JSON.createObjectBuilder()
                .add("message", "Hello World")
                .build();
    }
}
```

- This class is annotated with `Path` which sets the path for this
  resource as `/greet`.

- The `RequestScoped` annotation defines that this bean is request
  scoped. The request scope is active only for the duration of one web
  service invocation, and it is destroyed at the end of that invocation.
  You can learn more about scopes and contexts, and how they are used
  from the
  [Specification](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0.html).

- A `public JsonObject getDefaultMessage()` method is defined which is
  annotated with `GET`, meaning it will accept the HTTP GET method. It
  is also annotated with `Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)` which
  declares that this method will return JSON data.

- The method body creates a JSON object containing a single object named
  "message" with the content "Hello World". This method will be expanded
  and improved later in the tutorial.

> [!TIP]
> So far this is just a JAX-RS application, with no Helidon or
> MicroProfile specific code in it. There are many JAX-RS tutorials
> available if you want to learn more about this kind of application.

A main class is also required to start up the server and run the
application. If you don’t use Helidon’s built-in main class you can
define your own:
```java
public final class Main {

    public static void main(final String[] args) throws IOException {
        Server server = startServer();
        System.out.println("http://localhost:" + server.port() + "/greet");
    }

    static Server startServer() {
        return Server.create().start();
    }
}
```

In this class, a `main` method is defined which starts the Helidon MP
server and prints out a message with the listen address.

- Notice that this class has an empty no-args constructor to make sure
  this class cannot be instantiated.

- The MicroProfile server is started with the default configuration.

Helidon MP applications also require a `beans.xml` resource file to tell
Helidon to use the annotations discussed above to discover Java beans in
the application.

Create a `beans.xml` in the `src/main/resources/META-INF` directory with
the following content:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee
                           http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/beans_2_0.xsd"
       version="2.0"
       bean-discovery-mode="annotated">
</beans>
```

- The `bean-discovery-mode` tells Helidon to look for the annotations to
  discover Java beans in the application.

# Build the Application

Helidon MP applications are packaged into a JAR file and the
dependencies are copied into a `libs` directory.

You can now build the application:
```shell
mvn package
```

This will build the application jar and save all runtime dependencies in
the `target/libs` directory. This means you can easily start the
application by running the application jar file:

Run the application:
```shell
java -jar target/helidon-mp-tutorial.jar
```

At this stage, the application is a very simple "Hello World" greeting
service. It supports a single GET request for generating a greeting
message. The response is encoded using JSON. For example:

Try the Application:
```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:7001/greet
```

JSON response:
```json
{"message":"Hello World!"}
```

In the output you can see the JSON output from the `getDefaultMessage()`
method that was discussed earlier. The server has used a default port
`7001`. The application can be stopped cleanly by pressing Ctrl+C.

# Configuration

Helidon MP applications can use the
`META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file to specify configuration
data. This file (resource) is read by default if it is present on the
classpath. Create this file in `src/main/resources/META-INF` with the
following content:
```shell
# Microprofile server properties
server.port=8080
server.host=0.0.0.0
```

Rebuild the application and run it again. Notice that it now uses port
8080 as specified in the configuration file.

> [!TIP]
> You can learn more about options for configuring the Helidon Server on
> the [Server Configuration](../server.md) page.

In addition to predefined server properties, application-specific
configuration information can be added to this file. Add the
`app.greeting` property to the file as shown below. This property will
be used to set the content of greeting message.

Updated `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`:
```shell
# Microprofile server properties
server.port=8080
server.host=0.0.0.0

# Application properties
app.greeting=Hello
```

Add a new "provider" class to read this property and make it available
to the application. The class will be called `GreetingProvider.java` and
have the following content:
```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetingProvider {
    private final AtomicReference<String> message = new AtomicReference<>();

    @Inject
    public GreetingProvider(@ConfigProperty(name = "app.greeting") String message) {
        this.message.set(message);
    }

    String getMessage() {
        return message.get();
    }

    void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message.set(message);
    }
}
```

- This class also has the `ApplicationScoped` annotation, so it will
  persist for the life of the application.

- The class contains an `AtomicReference` to a `String` where the
  greeting will be stored. The `AtomicReference` provides lock-free
  thread-safe access to the underlying `String`.

- The `GreetingProvider` constructor is annotated with
  `Inject` which tells Helidon to use Contexts and Dependency Injection
  to provide the needed values. In this case, the `String message` is
  annotated with `ConfigProperty(name = "app.greeting")` so Helidon will
  inject the property from the configuration file with the key
  `app.greeting`. This method demonstrates how to read configuration
  information into the application. A getter and setter are also
  included in this class.

The `GreetResource` must be updated to use this value instead of the
hard coded response. Make the following updates to that class:
```java
@Path("/greet")
@RequestScoped
public class GreetResource {

    private static final JsonBuilderFactory JSON = Json.createBuilderFactory(Map.of());
    private final GreetingProvider greetingProvider;

    @Inject
    public GreetResource(GreetingProvider greetingConfig) {
        this.greetingProvider = greetingConfig;
    }

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public JsonObject getDefaultMessage() {
        return createResponse("World");
    }

    private JsonObject createResponse(String who) {
        String msg = String.format("%s %s!", greetingProvider.getMessage(), who);
        return JSON.createObjectBuilder()
                .add("message", msg)
                .build();
    }
}
```

- This updated class adds a `GreetingProvider` and uses constructor
  injection to get the value from the configuration file.

- The logic to create the response message is refactored into a
  `createResponse` method and the `getDefaultMessage()` method is
  updated to use this new method.

- In `createResponse()` the message is obtained from the
  `GreetingProvider` which in turn got it from the configuration files.

Rebuild and run the application. Notice that it now uses the greeting
from the configuration file. Change the configuration file and restart
the application, notice that it uses the changed value.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about Helidon MP configuration please see the
> [Config](../config/introduction.md) section of the documentation.

# Extending the Application

In this section, the application will be extended to add a PUT resource
method which will allow users to update the greeting and a second GET
resource method which will accept a parameter.

Here are the two new methods to add to `GreetResource.java`:

```java
@Path("/{name}")
@GET
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public JsonObject getMessage(@PathParam("name") String name) {
    return createResponse(name);
}

@Path("/greeting")
@PUT
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public Response updateGreeting(JsonObject jsonObject) {

    if (!jsonObject.containsKey("greeting")) {
        JsonObject entity = Json.createObjectBuilder()
                .add("error", "No greeting provided")
                .build();
        return Response.status(Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST).entity(entity).build();
    }

    String newGreeting = jsonObject.getString("greeting");

    greetingProvider.setMessage(newGreeting);
    return Response.status(Response.Status.NO_CONTENT).build();
}
```

- The first of these two methods implements a new HTTP GET service that
  returns JSON, and it has a path parameter. The `Path` annotation
  defines the next part of the path to be a parameter named `name`. In
  the method arguments the `PathParam("name")` annotation on
  `String name` has the effect of passing the parameter from the URL
  into this method as `name`.

- The second method implements a new HTTP PUT service which produces and
  consumes JSON, note the `Consumes` and `PUT` annotations. It also
  defines a path of "/greeting". Notice that the method argument is a
  `JsonObject`. Inside the method body there is code to check for the
  expected JSON, extract the value and update the message in the
  `GreetingProvider`.

Rebuild and run the application. Test the new services using curl
commands similar to those shown below:

Testing the new services:
```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
{"message":"Hello World!"}

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Joe
{"message":"Hello Joe!"}

curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"greeting" : "Hola"}' http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Jose
{"message":"Hola Jose!"}
```

Helidon MP provides many other features which can be added to the
application.

# Logging

The application logging can be customized. The default logging provider
is `java.util.logging`, however it is possible to use other providers.
In this tutorial the default provider is used.

Create a `logging.properties` file in `src/main/resources` with the
following content:

Example logging.properties file
```properties
# Send messages to the console
handlers=io.helidon.logging.jul.HelidonConsoleHandler

# HelidonConsoleHandler uses a SimpleFormatter subclass that replaces "!thread!" with the current thread
java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=%1$tY.%1$tm.%1$td %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS %4$s %3$s !thread!: %5$s%6$s%n

# Global logging level. Can be overridden by specific loggers
.level=INFO
```

- The Helidon console logging handler is configured. This handler writes
  to `System.out`, does not filter by level and uses a custom
  `SimpleFormatter` that supports thread names.

- The format string is set using the standard options to include the
  timestamp, thread name and message.

- The global logging level is set to `INFO`.

The Helidon MicroProfile server will detect the new `logging.properties`
file and configure the LogManager for you.

Rebuild and run the application and notice the new logging format takes effect.

Log output:
```shell
// before

http://localhost:8080/greet
```

# Metrics

Helidon provides built-in support for metrics endpoints.

Metrics in Prometheus Format:
```shell
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

Metrics in JSON Format:
```shell
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -X GET http://localhost:8080/metrics
```
It is possible to disable metrics by adding properties to the
`microprofile-config.properties` file, for example:

Disable a metric:
```properties
metrics.base.classloader.currentLoadedClass.count.enabled=false
```

Call the metrics endpoint before adding this change to confirm that the
metric is included, then add the property to disable the metric, rebuild
and restart the application and check again:

Checking metrics before and after disabling the metric:
```shell
# before
curl -s http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep classloader_current
# TYPE base:classloader_current_loaded_class_count counter
# HELP base:classloader_current_loaded_class_count Displays the number of classes that are currently loaded in the Java virtual machine.
base:classloader_current_loaded_class_count 7936

# after
curl -s http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep classloader_current
# (no output)
```

Helidon also support custom metrics. To add a new metric, annotate the
JAX-RS resource with one of the metric annotations as shown in the
example below:

> [!TIP]
> You can find details of the available annotations in the [MicroProfile
> Metrics
> Specification](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-metrics-5.1.1/microprofile-metrics-spec-5.1.1.html)

Updated GreetResource.java with custom metrics

```java
@GET
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Timed
public JsonObject getDefaultMessage() {
    return createResponse("World");
}
```

- The `Timed` annotation is added to the `getDefaultMessage()` method.

Rebuild and run the application. Make some calls to the endpoint
(http://localhost:8080/greet) so there will be some data to report.
Then obtain the application metrics as follows:

Checking the application metrics:
```shell
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/metrics/application
{
  "io.helidon.examples.GreetResource.getDefaultMessage": {
    "count": 2,
    "meanRate": 0.036565171873527716,
    "oneMinRate": 0.015991117074135343,

    "p999": 1614077
  }
}
```

# Health Check

Helidon provides built-in support for health check endpoints. Obtain the
built-in health check using the following URL:

Health check:
```shell
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:8080/health
{
  "outcome": "UP",
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "deadlock",
      "state": "UP",
      "status": "UP"
    },
    {
      "name": "diskSpace",
      "state": "UP",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "free": "381.23 GB",
        "freeBytes": 409340088320,
        "percentFree": "43.39%",
        "total": "878.70 GB",
        "totalBytes": 943491723264
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "heapMemory",
      "state": "UP",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "free": "324.90 MB",
        "freeBytes": 340682920,
        "max": "3.46 GB",
        "maxBytes": 3715629056,
        "percentFree": "97.65%",
        "total": "408.00 MB",
        "totalBytes": 427819008
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Endpoints for readiness and liveness checks are also provided by
default. Obtain the default results using these URLs, which return the
same result as the previous example.:

Default readiness and liveness endpoints:
```shell
# readiness
curl -i  -X GET http://localhost:8080/health/ready

# liveness
curl -i  -X GET http://localhost:8080/health/live
```

Helidon allows the addition of custom health checks to applications.
Create a new class `GreetHealthcheck.java` with the following content:

```java
@Liveness
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetHealthcheck implements HealthCheck {

    private GreetingProvider provider;

    @Inject
    public GreetHealthcheck(GreetingProvider provider) {
        this.provider = provider;
    }

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        String message = provider.getMessage();
        return HealthCheckResponse.named("greeting")
                .status("Hello".equals(message))
                .withData("greeting", message)
                .build();
    }
}
```

- This class has the MicroProfile `Liveness` annotation which tells
  Helidon that this class provides a custom health check. You can learn
  more about the available annotations in the [MicroProfile Health Protocol and Wireformat](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-health-4.0/microprofile-health-spec-4.0.html##_protocol_and_wireformat) document.

- This class also has the `ApplicationScoped` annotation, as seen
  previously.

- The `GreetingProvider` is injected using Context and Dependency
  Service. This example will use the greeting to determine whether the
  application is healthy, this is a contrived example for demonstration
  purposes.

- Health checks must implement the `HealthCheck` functional interface,
  which includes the method `HealthCheckResponse call()`. Helidon will
  invoke the `call()` method to verify the healthiness of the
  application.

- In this example, the application is deemed to be healthy if the
  `GreetingProvider,getMessage()` method returns the string `"Hello"`
  and unhealthy otherwise.

Rebuild the application, make sure that the `mp.conf` has the `greeting`
set to something other than `"Hello"` and then run the application and
check the health:

Custom health check reporting unhealthy state:

```shell
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/health/live
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 23 Aug 2019 10:07:23 -0400
transfer-encoding: chunked
connection: keep-alive

{"outcome":"DOWN","status":"DOWN","checks":[{"name":"deadlock","state":"UP","status":"UP"},{"name":"diskSpace","state":"UP","status":"UP","data":{"free":"381.08 GB","freeBytes":409182306304,"percentFree":"43.37%","total":"878.70 GB","totalBytes":943491723264}},{"name":"greeting","state":"DOWN","status":"DOWN","data":{"greeting":"Hey"}},{"name":"heapMemory","state":"UP","status":"UP","data":{"free":"243.81 MB","freeBytes":255651048,"max":"3.46 GB","maxBytes":3715629056,"percentFree":"98.58%","total":"294.00 MB","totalBytes":308281344}}]}
```

- The HTTP return code is now 503 Service Unavailable.
- The status is reported as "DOWN" and the custom check is included in
  the output.

Now update the greeting to `"Hello"` using the following request, and
then check health again:
```shell
# update greeting
curl -i -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"greeting": "Hello"}' http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Date: Thu, 22 Aug 2019 13:29:57 -0400
connection: keep-alive

# check health
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/health/live
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 23 Aug 2019 10:08:09 -0400
connection: keep-alive
content-length: 536

{"outcome":"UP","status":"UP","checks":[{"name":"deadlock","state":"UP","status":"UP"},{"name":"diskSpace","state":"UP","status":"UP","data":{"free":"381.08 GB","freeBytes":409179811840,"percentFree":"43.37%","total":"878.70 GB","totalBytes":943491723264}},{"name":"greeting","state":"UP","status":"UP","data":{"greeting":"Hello"}},{"name":"heapMemory","state":"UP","status":"UP","data":{"free":"237.25 MB","freeBytes":248769720,"max":"3.46 GB","maxBytes":3715629056,"percentFree":"98.40%","total":"294.00 MB","totalBytes":308281344}}]}
```

- The PUT returns an HTTP 204.

- The health check now returns an HTTP 200.

- The status is now reported as "UP" and the details are provided in the
  checks.

Learn more about health checks in the [Health Check Guide](health.md).

# Build a Docker Image

To run the application in Docker (or Kubernetes), a `Dockerfile` is
needed to build a Docker image. To build the Docker image, you need to
have Docker installed and running on your system.

Add a new `Dockerfile` in the project root directory with the following
content:
```shell
FROM container-registry.oracle.com/java/openjdk:21 as build

# Install maven
WORKDIR /usr/share
RUN set -x && \
    curl -O https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.8.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.tar.gz && \
    tar -xvf apache-maven-*-bin.tar.gz  && \
    rm apache-maven-*-bin.tar.gz && \
    mv apache-maven-* maven && \
    ln -s /usr/share/maven/bin/mvn /bin/

WORKDIR /helidon

ADD pom.xml .
RUN mvn package -DskipTests

ADD src src
RUN mvn package -DskipTests
RUN echo "done!"

FROM container-registry.oracle.com/java/openjdk:21
WORKDIR /helidon

COPY --from=build /helidon/target/helidon-mp-tutorial.jar ./
COPY --from=build /helidon/target/libs ./libs

CMD ["java", "-jar", "helidon-mp-tutorial.jar"]
EXPOSE 8080
```

- This Dockerfile uses Docker’s multi-stage build feature. The `FROM`
  keyword creates the first stage. In this stage, the base container has
  the build tools needed to build the application. These are not
  required to run the application, so the second stage uses a smaller
  container.

- Add the `pom.xml` and running an "empty" maven build will download all
  the dependencies and plugins in this layer. This will make future
  builds faster because they will use this cached layer rather than
  downloading everything again.

- Add the source code and do the real build.

- Copy the binary and libraries from the first stage.

- Set the initial command and expose port 8080.

To create the Docker image, use the following command:
```shell
docker build -t helidon-mp-tutorial .
```

Make sure the application is shutdown if it was still running locally so
that port 8080 will not be in use, then start the application in Docker
using the following command:
```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 helidon-mp-tutorial:latest
```

Try the application as before.
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/greet/bob
{"message":"Howdee bob!"}

curl http://localhost:8080/health/ready
{"outcome":"UP","status":"UP","checks":[]}
```

# Deploy the application to Kubernetes

If you don’t have access to a Kubernetes cluster, you can [install one on your desktop](../../about/kubernetes.md).

Then deploy the example:
```shell
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```

To deploy the application to Kubernetes, a Kubernetes YAML file that
defines the deployment and associated resources is needed. In this case
all that is required is the deployment and a service.

Create a file called `app.yaml` in the project’s root directory with the
following content:
```yaml
---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: helidon-mp-tutorial
  labels:
    app: helidon-mp-tutorial
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: helidon-mp-tutorial
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      name: http
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: helidon-mp-tutorial
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helidon-mp-tutorial
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helidon-mp-tutorial
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helidon-mp-tutorial
          image: helidon-mp-tutorial
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

- Define a Service to provide access to the application.

- Define a NodePort to expose the application outside the Kubernetes
  cluster.

- Define a Deployment of the application.

- Define how many replicas of the application to run.

- Define the Docker image to use - this must be the one that was built
  in the previous step. If the image was built on a different machine to
  the one where Kubernetes is running, or if Kubernetes is running on
  multiple machines (worker nodes) then the image must either be
  manually copied to each node or otherwise pushed to a Docker registry
  that is accessible to the worker nodes.

This Kubernetes YAML file can be used to deploy the application to
Kubernetes:
```shell
kubectl create -f app.yaml
kubectl get pods # Wait for quickstart pod to be RUNNING
```

> [!TIP]
> Remember, if Kubernetes is running on a different machine, or inside a
> VM (as in Docker for Desktop) then the Docker image must either be
> manually copied to the Kubernetes worker nodes or pushed to a Docker
> registry that is accessible to those worker nodes. Update the `image`
> entry in the example above to include the Docker registry name. If the
> registry is private a Docker registry secret will also be required.

The step above created a service that is exposed using any available
node port. Kubernetes allocates a free port. Lookup the service to find
the port.

Lookup the service:
```shell
kubectl get service helidon-mp-tutorial
```

Note the PORTs. The application can be exercised as before but use the
second port number (the NodePort) instead of 8080. For example:

Access the application:
```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:31431/greet
```

If desired, the Kubernetes YAML file can also be used to remove the
application from Kubernetes as follows:
```shell
kubectl delete -f app.yaml
```
