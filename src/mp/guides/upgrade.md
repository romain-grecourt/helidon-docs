In Helidon 2.x we have made some changes to APIs and runtime behavior.
This guide will help you migrate a Helidon MP 1.x application to 2.x.

# Java 11 Runtime

Java 8 is no longer supported in Helidon 2. Java 11 or newer is
required.

# Tracing

We have upgraded to OpenTracing version 0.33.0 that is not backward
compatible. OpenTracing introduced the following breaking changes:

| Removed                                            | Replacement                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ScopeManager.active()`                            | `Tracer.activeSpan()`                                                  |
| `ScopeManager.activate(Span, boolean)`             | `ScopeManager.activate(Span)` - second parameter is now always `false` |
| `SpanBuilder.startActive()`                        | `Tracer.activateSpan(Span)`                                            |
| `TextMapExtractAdapter` and `TextMapInjectAdapter` | `TextMapAdapter`                                                       |
| Module name changed `opentracing.api`              | `io.opentracing.api` (same for `noop` and `util`)                      |

If you use the `TracerBuilder` abstraction in Helidon and have no custom
Spans, there is no change required

# Security: OIDC

When the OIDC provider is configured to use cookie (default
configuration) to carry authentication information, the cookie
`Same-Site` is now set to `Lax` (used to be `Strict`). This is to
prevent infinite redirects, as browsers would refuse to set the cookie
on redirected requests (due to this setting). Only in the case of the
frontend host and identity host match, we leave `Strict` as the default

# MicroProfile Bundles

We have removed the versioned MicroProfile bundles (i.e.
`helidon-microprofile-x.x`), and introduced unversioned core and full
bundles:

- `io.helidon.microprofile.bundles:helidon-microprofile-core` - contains
  only MP Server and Config. Allows you to add only the specifications
  needed by your application.

- `io.helidon.microprofile.bundles:helidon-microprofile` - contains the
  latest full MicroProfile version implemented by Helidon

# Application Main and Startup

- `io.helidon.microprofile.server.Main` has been deprecated. Use
  `io.helidon.microprofile.cdi.Main` instead.

- `io.helidon.microprofile.server.Server` is still available, although
  the features are much reduced.

- You no longer need to initialize Java Util Logging explicitly. Put
  `logging.properties` on the classpath or in the current directory to
  be automatically picked up to configure Java Util Logging.

# JAX-RS Applications

Helidon 1.x usually required that you have an `Application` subclass
that returned the Application classes to scan. For common cases this is
no longer necessary, and you might be able to remove your `Application`
class.

JAX-RS applications now work similarly to how they work in application
servers:

- if there is an `Application` subclass that returns anything from
  `getClasses` or `getSingletons`, it is used as is

- if there is an `Application` subclass that returns empty sets from
  these methods, all available resource classes will be part of such an
  application

- if there is no `Application` subclass, a synthetic application will be
  created with all available resource classes

- `Application` subclasses MUST be annotated with `@ApplicationScoped`,
  otherwise they are ignored

# MicroProfile JWT-Auth

If a JAX-RS application exists that is annotated with `@LoginConfig`
with value MP-JWT, the correct authentication provider is added to
security. The startup would fail if the provider is required yet not
configured.

# Security in Helidon MP

- If there is no authentication provider configured, authentication will
  now fail.

- If there is no authorization provider configured, the ABAC provider
  will be configured.

In Helidon 1.x these were configured if there was no provider configured
overall.

# CDI and MicroProfile Server

In order to support GraalVM `native-image` we have had to re-implement
how CDI is initialized and started. This has resulted in some changes in
APIs and behavior:

- You can no longer start the CDI container yourself.

- You can only run a single instance of Server in a JVM.

- If you use `SeContainerInitializer` you will get an exception.

  - This can be worked around by configuration property
    `mp.initializer.allow=true`, and warning can be removed using
    `mp.initializer.no-warn=true`

  - Once `SeContainerInitializer` is used you can no longer use MP with
    `native-image`

- You can no longer provide a `Context` instance. The root context is
  now built-in.

- `MpService` and `MpServiceContext` have been removed.

  - Methods from context have been moved to `JaxRsCdiExtension` and
    `ServerCdiExtension`. These can be accessed from CDI extension
    through `BeanManager.getExtension`.

  - Methods `register` can be used on current
    `io.helidon.context.Context`

  - `MpService` equivalent is a CDI extension. All Helidon services were
    refactored to CDI extension (you can use these for reference).

- `Server.cdiContainer` is removed, use `CDI.current()` instead.

# Metrics

Helidon now supports only MicroProfile Metrics 2.x. Support for Metrics
1.x has been removed, and modules for 2.x have been renamed from
`metrics2` to `metrics`.

# Java EE dependencies

We have moved from dependencies in groupId `javax` (Java EE modules) to
dependencies in groupId `jakarta` (Jakarta EE modules).

In case you declared a dependency on a javax module, you should change
it to a jakarta one.

Example:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.activation</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.activation-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

should be changed to

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.activation</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.activation-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

As the `javax` module is no longer in dependency management of Helidon
parent pom files.
