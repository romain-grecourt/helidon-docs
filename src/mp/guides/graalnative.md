This guide describes how to build a GraalVM native image for a Helidon
MP application.

# Introduction

[Native images](https://www.graalvm.org/jdk21/reference-manual/native-image/)
are ahead-of-time compiled Java code that result in a self contained
native executable. When used appropriately native images have
dramatically faster startup and lower runtime memory overhead compared
to a Java VM.

In this guide you will learn how to build a native image locally on your
machine, as well as using Docker.

| [GraalVM for JDK 21](https://www.graalvm.org/release-notes/JDK_21/)                                     | `native-image` support requires GraalVM for JDK 21. When running in the Graal JVM (not native-image) Helidon supports GraalVM for JDK 21 or newer.  |

Verify Prerequisites:
```shell
java -version
mvn --version
docker --version
kubectl version
```

Setting JAVA_HOME:
```shell
# On Mac
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21`

# On Linux
# Use the appropriate path to your JDK
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-21
```

# Install GraalVM and the Native Image Command

After [downloading and
installing](https://www.graalvm.org/jdk21//docs/getting-started/)
GraalVM, set the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to point at your
GraalVM installation, or use the GraalVM installation as your Java home.

```shell
# Your path might be different
export GRAALVM_HOME=/usr/local/graalvm-jdk-21+35.1/Contents/Home/
```

Then verify:

```shell
$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/java -version
$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image --version
```

# Generate the Project

Generate the project using the Helidon MP Quickstart Maven archetype.

```shell
mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -DarchetypeVersion=4.4.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.examples \
    -DartifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp
```

The archetype generates a Maven project in your current directory (for
example, `helidon-quickstart-mp`). Change into this directory and build.

```shell
cd helidon-quickstart-mp
mvn package
```

At this point you can run the application using the JVM:

```shell
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-mp.jar
```

In another shell, test an endpoint:

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
```

The application should respond with `{"message":"Hello World!"}`

Now stop the running application (by pressing Ctrl+C).

For more information about the Quickstart application and other
endpoints it supports see the [Helidon MP Quickstart
Guide](../../mp/guides/quickstart.md).

# Building a Native Image

You can build a native executable in 2 different ways:

- With a local installation of GraalVM

- Using Docker

## Local build

Make sure you have GraalVM locally installed:

```shell
$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image --version
```

Build the native image using the native image profile:

```shell
mvn package -Pnative-image
```

> [!TIP]
> This uses the `org.graalvm.buildtools:native-maven-plugin` to perform
> the native compilation using your installed copy of GraalVM. It might
> take a while to complete.

Once it completes start the application using the native executable (no
JVM!):

```shell
./target/helidon-quickstart-mp
```

Yep, it starts fast. You can exercise the application’s endpoints as
before.

## Multi-stage Docker build

Build the "native" Docker image

```shell
docker build -t helidon-quickstart-mp-native -f Dockerfile.native .
```

> [!TIP]
> This does a full build inside the Docker container. The first time you
> run it, it will take a while because it is downloading all the
> Maven dependencies and caching them in a Docker layer. Subsequent
> builds will be much faster as long as you don’t change the `pom.xml`
> file. If the pom is modified then the dependencies will be
> re-downloaded.

Start the application:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 helidon-quickstart-mp-native:latest
```

Again, it starts fast. You can exercise the application’s endpoints as
before.

# When should I use Native Images?

Native images are ideal for applications with high horizontal
scalability requirements where the ability to rapidly scale out to
numerous instances is important.

That said, native images do have some[limitations](https://www.graalvm.org/jdk21/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/Compatibility/),
and for long-running applications where startup and footprint are less
of a priority, the Java SE HotSpot VM might be more appropriate.

For information about creating custom Java runtime images see
[Custom Runtime Images with`jlink`](../../mp/guides/jlink-image.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When building Helidon using native-image, we check features on
> classpath, and warn if there is a problem or restriction of support
