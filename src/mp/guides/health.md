This guide describes how to create a sample MicroProfile (MP) project
that can be used to run some basic examples using both built-in and
custom health checks with Helidon MP.

Prerequisite product versions for Helidon 4.4.0-SNAPSHOT

Verify Prerequisites:
```shell
java -version
mvn --version
docker --version
kubectl version
```

Setting JAVA_HOME:
```shell
# On Mac
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21`

# On Linux
# Use the appropriate path to your JDK
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-21
```

## Create a Sample MP Project

Generate the project sources using the Helidon MP Maven archetype. The
result is a simple project that can be used for the examples in this
guide.

Run the Maven archetype:
```shell
mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -DarchetypeVersion=4.4.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.examples \
    -DartifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp
```

## Using the Built-In Health Checks

Helidon has a set of built-in health checks:

- deadlock detection

- available disk space

- available heap memory

The following example will demonstrate how to use the built-in health
checks. These examples are all executed from the root directory of your
project (helidon-quickstart-mp).

Include dependency for the built-in health checks:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.health</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-health-checks</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Build the application then run it:
```shell
mvn package
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-mp.jar
```

Verify the health endpoint in a new terminal window:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

JSON response:
```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "deadlock",
      "status": "UP"
    },
    {
      "name": "diskSpace",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "free": "325.54 GB",
        "freeBytes": 349543358464,
        "percentFree": "69.91%",
        "total": "465.63 GB",
        "totalBytes": 499963174912
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "heapMemory",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "free": "230.87 MB",
        "freeBytes": 242085696,
        "max": "3.56 GB",
        "maxBytes": 3817865216,
        "percentFree": "98.90%",
        "total": "271.00 MB",
        "totalBytes": 284164096
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Custom Liveness Health Checks

You can create application-specific custom health checks and integrate
them with Helidon using CDI. The following example shows how to add a
custom liveness health check.

Create a new `GreetLivenessCheck` class with the following content:

```java
@Liveness
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetLivenessCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.named("LivenessCheck")
                .up()
                .withData("time", System.currentTimeMillis())
                .build();
    }
}
```

- Annotation indicating this is a liveness health check.

- Annotation indicating there is a single liveness `HealthCheck` object
  during the lifetime of the application.

- Build the HealthCheckResponse with status `UP` and the current time.

Build and run the application, then verify the custom liveness health
endpoint

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/health/live
```

JSON response:
```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "LivenessCheck",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "time": 1566338255331
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Custom Readiness Health Checks

You can add a readiness check to indicate that the application is ready
to be used. In this example, the server will wait five seconds before it
becomes ready.

Create a new `GreetReadinessCheck` class with the following content:
```java
@Readiness
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetReadinessCheck implements HealthCheck {
    private final AtomicLong readyTime = new AtomicLong(0);

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.named("ReadinessCheck")
                .status(isReady())
                .withData("time", readyTime.get())
                .build();
    }

    public void onStartUp(
            @Observes @Initialized(ApplicationScoped.class) Object init) {
        readyTime.set(System.currentTimeMillis());
    }

    /**
     * Become ready after 5 seconds
     *
     * @return true if application ready
     */
    private boolean isReady() {
        return Duration.ofMillis(System.currentTimeMillis() - readyTime.get()).getSeconds() >= 5;
    }
}
```

- Annotation indicating that this is a readiness health check.

- Build the `HealthCheckResponse` with status `UP` after five seconds,
  else `DOWN`.

- Record the time at startup.

Build and run the application. Issue the curl command with -v within
five seconds, and you will see that the application is not ready:

```shell
curl -v  http://localhost:8080/health/ready
```

HTTP response status:
```text
< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
```

- The HTTP status is `503` since the application is not ready.

Response body:
```json
{
  "status": "DOWN",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "ReadinessCheck",
      "status": "DOWN",
      "data": {
        "time": 1566399775700
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

After five seconds you will see the application is ready:
```shell
curl -v http://localhost:8080/health/ready
```

HTTP response status:
```text
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

- The HTTP status is `200` indicating that the application is ready.

Response body:

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "ReadinessCheck",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "time": 1566399775700
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Custom Startup Health Checks

You can add a startup check to indicate if the application is
initialized to the point that the other health checks make sense. In
this example, the server will wait eight seconds before it declares
itself started.

Create a new `GreetStartedCheck` class with the following content:
```java
@Startup
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetStartedCheck implements HealthCheck {
    private final AtomicLong readyTime = new AtomicLong(0);

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.named("StartedCheck")
                .status(isStarted())
                .withData("time", readyTime.get())
                .build();
    }

    public void onStartUp(
            @Observes @Initialized(ApplicationScoped.class) Object init) {
        readyTime.set(System.currentTimeMillis());
    }

    boolean isStarted() {
        return Duration.ofMillis(System.currentTimeMillis() - readyTime.get()).getSeconds() >= 8;
    }
}
```

- Annotation indicating that this is a startup health check.

- Build the `HealthCheckResponse` with status `UP` after eight seconds,
  else `DOWN`.

- Record the time at startup of Helidon; the application will declare
  itself as started eight seconds later.

Build and run the application. Issue the curl command with -v within
five seconds, and you will see that the application has not yet started:
```shell
curl -v  http://localhost:8080/health/started
```

HTTP response status:
```text
< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
```

- The HTTP status is `503` since the application has not started.

Response body:
```json
{
  "status": "DOWN",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "StartedCheck",
      "status": "DOWN",
      "data": {
        "time": 1566399775700
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
After eight seconds you will see the application has started:
```shell
curl -v http://localhost:8080/health/started
```

HTTP response status:
```text
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

- The HTTP status is `200` indicating that the application is started.

Response body:
```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "StartedCheck",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "time": 1566399775700
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

When using the health check URLs, you can get the following health check
data:

- liveness only - http://localhost:8080/health/live

- readiness only - http://localhost:8080/health/ready

- startup checks only - http://localhost:8080/health/started

- all health check data - http://localhost:8080/health

Get all the health check data, including custom data:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

JSON response:
```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "LivenessCheck",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "time": 1566403431536
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "ReadinessCheck",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "time": 1566403280639
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "StartedCheck",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "time": 1566403280639
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "deadlock",
      "state": "UP",
      "status": "UP"
    },
    {
      "name": "diskSpace",
      "state": "UP",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "free": "325.50 GB",
        "freeBytes": 349500698624,
        "percentFree": "69.91%",
        "total": "465.63 GB",
        "totalBytes": 499963174912
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "heapMemory",
      "state": "UP",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "free": "231.01 MB",
        "freeBytes": 242235928,
        "max": "3.56 GB",
        "maxBytes": 3817865216,
        "percentFree": "98.79%",
        "total": "275.00 MB",
        "totalBytes": 288358400
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Custom Health Root Path and Port

You can specify a custom port and root context for the root health
endpoint path. However, you cannot use different ports, such as
http://localhost:8080/myhealth and
http://localhost:8081/myhealth/live. Likewise, you cannot use
different paths, such as http://localhost:8080/health and
http://localhost:8080/probe/live.

The example below will change the root path.

Create a file named `application.yaml` in the `resources` directory with
the following contents:

```yaml
health:
  endpoint: "/myhealth"
```

- The `endpoint` settings specifies the root path for the health
  endpoint.

Build and run the application, then verify that the health endpoint is
using the new `/myhealth` root:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/myhealth
curl http://localhost:8080/myhealth/live
curl http://localhost:8080/myhealth/ready
curl http://localhost:8080/myhealth/started
```

The following example will change the root path and the health port.

Update application.yaml to use a different port and root path for the
health endpoint:
```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  sockets:
    - name: "admin"
      port: 8081
  features:
    observe:
      sockets: "admin"
health:
  endpoint: "/myhealth"
```

- The default port for the application.

- The name of the new socket, it can be any name, this example uses
  `admin`.

- The port for the `admin` socket.

- The health endpoint, as part of Helidon’s observability support, uses
  the socket `admin`.

Build and run the application, then verify the health endpoint using
port `8081` and `/myhealth`:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8081/myhealth
curl http://localhost:8081/myhealth/live
curl http://localhost:8081/myhealth/ready
curl http://localhost:8081/myhealth/started
```

## Using Liveness, Readiness, and Startup Health Checks with Kubernetes

The following example shows how to integrate the Helidon health check
API with an application that implements health endpoints for the
Kubernetes liveness, readiness, and startup probes.

**Delete the contents of `application.yaml` so that the default health
endpoint path and port are used.**

Rebuild and start the application, then verify the health endpoint:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

Stop the application and build the docker image:
```shell
docker build -t helidon-quickstart-mp .
```

Create the Kubernetes YAML specification, named `health.yaml`, with the
following content:

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: helidon-health
  labels:
    app: helidon-health
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: helidon-health
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      name: http
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: helidon-health
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helidon-health
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helidon-health
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helidon-health
          image: helidon-quickstart-mp
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/live
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 10
            timeoutSeconds: 3
            failureThreshold: 3
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/ready
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 2
            timeoutSeconds: 3
          startupProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/started
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 8
            periodSeconds: 10
            timeoutSeconds: 3
            failureThreshold: 3
---
```

- A service of type `NodePort` that serves the default routes on port
  `8080`.

- A deployment with one replica of a pod.

- The HTTP endpoint for the liveness probe.

- The liveness probe configuration.

- The HTTP endpoint for the readiness probe.

- The readiness probe configuration.

- The HTTP endpoint for the startup probe.

- The startup probe configuration.

Create and deploy the application into Kubernetes:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./health.yaml
```

Get the service information:
```shell
kubectl get service/helidon-health
```

```shell
NAME             TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
helidon-health   NodePort   10.107.226.62   <none>        8080:30116/TCP   4s
```

- A service of type `NodePort` that serves the default routes on port
  `30116`.

Verify the health endpoints using port '30116', your port may be
different. The JSON response will be the same as your previous test:

```shell
curl http://localhost:30116/health
```

Delete the application, cleaning up Kubernetes resources:
```shell
kubectl delete -f ./health.yaml
```
