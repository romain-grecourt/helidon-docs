# Introduction

Distributed tracing is a critical feature of microservice based
applications, since it traces workflow both within a service and across
multiple services. This provides insight to sequence and timing data for
specific blocks of work, which helps you identify performance and
operational issues. Helidon MP includes support for distributed tracing
through the [OpenTracing API](https://opentracing.io). Tracing is
integrated with WebServer and Security using either the
[Zipkin](https://zipkin.io) or [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io)
tracers.

## Tracing Concepts

This section explains a few concepts that you need to understand before
you get started with tracing.

- In the context of this document, a *service* is synonymous with an
  application.

- A *span* is the basic unit of work done within a single service, on a
  single host. Every span has a name, starting timestamp, and duration.
  For example, the work done by a REST endpoint is a span. A span is
  associated to a single service, but its descendants can belong to
  different services and hosts.

- A *trace* contains a collection of spans from one or more services,
  running on one or more hosts. For example, if you trace a service
  endpoint that calls another service, then the trace would contain
  spans from both services. Within a trace, spans are organized as a
  directed acyclic graph (DAG) and can belong to multiple services,
  running on multiple hosts. The *OpenTracing Data Model* describes the
  details at [The OpenTracing Semantic
  Specification](https://opentracing.io/specification). Spans are
  automatically created by Helidon as needed during execution of the
  REST request.

# Getting Started with Tracing

The examples in this guide demonstrate how to integrate tracing with
Helidon, how to view traces, how to trace across multiple services, and
how to integrate tracing with Kubernetes. All examples use Jaeger and
traces will be viewed using Jaeger UI.

## Create a Sample Helidon MP project

Use the Helidon MP Maven archetype to create a simple project that can
be used for the examples in this guide.

Run the Maven archetype:
```shell
mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -DarchetypeVersion=4.4.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.examples \
    -DartifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp
```

The project will be built and run from the `helidon-quickstart-mp`
directory:
```shell
cd helidon-quickstart-mp
```

## Set up Jaeger

First, you need to run the Jaeger tracer. Helidon will communicate with
this tracer at runtime.

Run Jaeger within a docker container, then check the Jaeger server
working:
```shell
docker run -d --name jaeger \                  
  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14269:14269 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.50
```

- Run the Jaeger docker image.

Check the Jaeger server by opening http://localhost:16686/search in your browser.

## Enable Tracing in the Helidon Application

Update the pom.xml file and add the following Jaeger dependency to the
`<dependencies>` section (**not** `<dependencyManagement>`). This will
enable Helidon to use Jaeger at the default host and port,
`localhost:14250`.

Add the following dependency to `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.tracing</groupId>
        <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-tracing</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.helidon.tracing.providers</groupId>
        <artifactId>helidon-tracing-providers-jaeger</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

All spans sent by Helidon to Jaeger need to be associated with a
service. Specify the service name below.

Add the following line to `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`:
```shell
tracing.service=helidon-mp-1
```

Build the application, skipping unit tests, then run it:
```shell
mvn package -DskipTests=true
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-mp.jar
```

Run the curl command in a new terminal window and check the response:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
```

JSON response:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello World!"
}
```

## View Tracing Using Jaeger UI

The tracing output data is verbose and can be difficult to interpret
using the REST API, especially since it represents a structure of spans.
Jaeger provides a web-based UI at <http://localhost:16686/search>, where
you can see a visual representation of the same data and the
relationship between spans within a trace. If you see a `Lens UI` button
at the top center then click on it, and it will take you to the specific
UI used by this guide.

Click on the UI Find traces button (the search icon) as shown in the
image below.

<figure>

<figcaption>Jaeger UI</figcaption>
</figure>

The image below shows the trace summary, including start time and
duration of each trace. There are several traces, each one generated in
response to a `curl http://localhost:8080/greet` invocation. The oldest
trace will have a much longer duration since there is one-time
initialization that occurs.

<figure>
<img src="file:///Users/jdipol/GitHub/barchetta/helidon/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/guides/12_tracing_top.png" alt="Traces" />
<figcaption>Tracing list view</figcaption>
</figure>

Click on a trace, and you will see the trace detail page where the spans
are listed. You can clearly see the root span and the relationship among
all the spans in the trace, along with timing information.

<figcaption>Trace detail page</figcaption>
</figure>

> [!NOTE]
> A parent span might not depend on the result of the child. This is
> called a `FollowsFrom` reference, see [Open Tracing Semantic
> Spec](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md).
> Note that the last span that writes the response after the root span
> ends falls into this category.

You can examine span details by clicking on the span row. Refer to the
image below, which shows the `security` span details, including timing
information. You can see times for each space relative to the root span.
These rows are annotated with `Server Start` and `Server Finish`, as
shown in the third column.

## Enable Tracing on CDI Beans

So far in this tutorial, you have used tracing with JAX-RS without
needing to annotate. You can enable tracing on other CDI beans, either
at the class level or at the method level, as shown by the following
examples.

### Tracing at the Method Level

To trace at the method level, you just annotate a method with @Traced.

Add the @Traced annotation to the `getMessage` method:
```java
class GreetingProvider {
    @Traced 
    String getMessage() {
        return message.get();
    }
}
```

- Enable tracing for getMessage.

Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoints and check the
response:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
```

Click the back button on your browser, then click on the UI refresh
button to see the new trace. Select the newest trace in the list to see
the trace detail page like the one below. Notice the new span named
`io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.greetingprovider.getmessage`.

### Tracing at the Class Level

To trace at the class level, annotate the class with @Traced. This will
enable tracing for all class methods, except for the constructor and
private methods.

Add @Traced to the `GreetingProvider` class and remove @Traced from the
`getMessage` method:
```java
@Traced 
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetingProvider {

    String getMessage() { 
        return message.get();
    }
}
```

- This will enable tracing for all class methods, except for the
  constructor and methods that are private.

- Remove @Traced for the `getMessage` method.

Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoints and check the
response:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
```

You can refresh the UI view and drill down the trace to see the new
spans.

> [!NOTE]
> Methods invoked directly by your code are not enabled for tracing,
> even if you explicitly annotate them with @Traced. Tracing only works
> for methods invoked on CDI beans. See the example below.

Update the `GreetingProvider` class with the following code:
```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetingProvider {
    private final AtomicReference<String> message = new AtomicReference<>();

    @Inject
    public GreetingProvider(@ConfigProperty(name = "app.greeting") String message) {
        this.message.set(message);
    }

    @Traced 
    String getMessage() {
        return getMessage2();
    }

    @Traced 
    String getMessage2() {
        return message.get();
    }

    void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message.set(message);
    }
}
```

- The `getMessage` method will be traced since it is externally invoked
  by `GreetResource`.

- The `getMessage2` method will not be traced, even with the @Traced
  annotation, since it is called internally by `getMessage`.

Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoints:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/greet
```

Then check the response in the Jaeger UI in the browser.

## Trace Across Services

Helidon automatically traces across services as long as the services use
the same tracer, for example, the same instance of Jaeger. This means a
single trace can include spans from multiple services and hosts.
OpenTracing uses a `SpanContext` to propagate tracing information across
process boundaries. When you make client API calls, Helidon will
internally call OpenTracing APIs to propagate the `SpanContext`. There
is nothing you need to do in your application to make this work.

To demonstrate distributed tracing, you will need to create a second
project, where the server listens on port 8081. Create a new root
directory to hold this new project, then do the following steps, similar
to what you did at the start of this guide:

### Create a second service

Run the Maven archetype:
```shell
mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -DarchetypeVersion=4.4.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.examples \
    -DartifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp-2 \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp
```

The project will be built and run from the `helidon-quickstart-mp`
directory:
```shell
cd helidon-quickstart-mp-2
```

Add the following dependency to `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.helidon.tracing.providers</groupId>
  <artifactId>helidon-tracing-providers-jaeger</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Replace `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` with the following:
```shell
app.greeting=Hello From MP-2
tracing.service=helidon-mp-2

# Microprofile server properties
server.port=8081
server.host=0.0.0.0
```

Build the application, skipping unit tests, then run it:
```shell
mvn package -DskipTests=true
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-mp-2.jar
```

Run the curl command in a new terminal window and check the response
(**notice the port is 8081**) :
```shell
curl http://localhost:8081/greet
```

JSON response:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello From MP-2 World!"
}
```

### Modify the first service

Once you have validated that the second service is running correctly,
you need to modify the original application to call it.

Replace the `GreetResource` class with the following code:
```java
@Path("/greet")
@RequestScoped
public class GreetResource {

    @Uri("http://localhost:8081/greet")
    private WebTarget target; 

    private static final JsonBuilderFactory JSON = Json.createBuilderFactory(Map.of());
    private final GreetingProvider greetingProvider;

    @Inject
    public GreetResource(GreetingProvider greetingConfig) {
        this.greetingProvider = greetingConfig;
    }

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public JsonObject getDefaultMessage() {
        return createResponse("World");
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/outbound") 
    public JsonObject outbound() {
        return target.request().accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE).get(JsonObject.class);
    }

    private JsonObject createResponse(String who) {
        String msg = String.format("%s %s!", greetingProvider.getMessage(), who);

        return JSON.createObjectBuilder().add("message", msg).build();
    }
}
```

- This is the `WebTarget` needed to send a request to the second service
  at port `8081`.
- This is the new endpoint that will call the second service.

Build and run the application, then invoke the endpoint and check the
response:
```shell
curl -i http://localhost:8080/greet/outbound 
```

- The request went to the service on `8080`, which then invoked the
  service at `8081` to get the greeting.

```json
{
  "message": "Hello From MP-2 World!" 
}
```

- Notice the greeting came from the second service.

Refresh the Jaeger UI trace listing page and notice that there is a
trace across two services.

<figure>
<img src="file:///Users/jdipol/GitHub/barchetta/helidon/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/guides/12_tracing_detail_2_services.png" alt="Traces" />
<figcaption>Tracing across multiple services detail view</figcaption>
</figure>

In the image above, you can see that the trace includes spans from two
services. You will notice there is a gap before the sixth span, which is
a `get` operation. This is a one-time client initialization delay. Run
the `/outbound` curl command again and look at the new trace to see that
the delay no longer exists.

You can now stop your second service, it is no longer used in this
guide.

# Integration with Kubernetes

The following example demonstrate how to use Jaeger from a Helidon
application running in Kubernetes.

Add the following line to `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`:
```properties
tracing.host=jaeger
```

Stop the application and build the docker image for your application:
```shell
docker build -t helidon-tracing-mp .
```

## Deploy Jaeger into Kubernetes

Create the Kubernetes YAML specification, named `jaeger.yaml`, with the
following contents:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: jaeger
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 16686
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: jaeger
---
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: jaeger
  labels:
    app: jaeger
spec:
  containers:
    - name: jaeger
      image: jaegertracing/all-in-one
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      ports:
        - containerPort: 16686
```

Create the Jaeger pod and ClusterIP service:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./jaeger.yaml
```

```shell
kubectl expose pod jaeger --name=jaeger-external --port=16687 --target-port=16686 --type=LoadBalancer 
```

- Create a service so that you can access the Jaeger UI.

Navigate to http://localhost:16687/search to validate that you can
access Jaeger running in Kubernetes. It may take a few seconds before it
is ready.

## Deploy Your Helidon Application into Kubernetes

Create the Kubernetes YAML specification, named `tracing.yaml`, with the
following contents:
```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: helidon-tracing 
  labels:
    app: helidon-tracing
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: helidon-tracing
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      name: http
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: helidon-tracing
spec:
  replicas: 1 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helidon-tracing
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helidon-tracing
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helidon-tracing
          image: helidon-tracing-mp
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

- A service of type `NodePort` that serves the default routes on port
  `8080`.

- A deployment with one replica of a pod.

Create and deploy the application into Kubernetes:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./tracing.yaml
```

## Access Your Application and the Jaeger Trace

Get the application service information:
```shell
kubectl get service/helidon-tracing
```

```shell
NAME             TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
helidon-tracing   NodePort   10.99.159.2   <none>        8080:31143/TCP   8s 
```

- A service of type `NodePort` that serves the default routes on port
  `31143`.

Verify the tracing endpoint using port `31143`, your port will likely be
different:
```shell
curl http://localhost:31143/greet
```

JSON response:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello World!"
}
```

Access the Jaeger UI at <http://localhost:16687/search> and click on the
refresh icon to see the trace that was just created.

## Cleanup

You can now delete the Kubernetes resources that were just created
during this example.

Delete the Kubernetes resources:
```shell
kubectl delete -f ./jaeger.yaml
kubectl delete -f ./tracing.yaml
kubectl delete service jaeger-external
docker rm -f jaeger
```

# Responding to Span Lifecycle Events

Applications and libraries can register listeners to be notified at
several moments during the lifecycle of every Helidon span:

- Before a new span starts

- After a new span has started

- After a span ends

- After a span is activated (creating a new scope)

- After a scope is closed

The next sections explain how you can write and add a listener and what
it can do. See the
[`SpanListener`](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.tracing/io/helidon/tracing/SpanListener.html)
Javadoc for more information.

## Understanding What Listeners Do

A listener cannot affect the lifecycle of a span or scope it is notified
about, but it can add tags and events and update the baggage associated
with a span. Often a listener does additional work that does not change
the span or scope such as logging a message.

When Helidon invokes the listener’s methods it passes proxies for the
`Span.Builder`, `Span`, and `Scope` arguments. These proxies limit the
access the listener has to the span builder, span, or scope, as
summarized in the following table. If a listener method tries to invoke
a forbidden operation, the proxy throws a
[`SpanListener.ForbiddenOperationException`](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.tracing/io/helidon/tracing/SpanListener.ForbiddenOperationException.html)
and Helidon then logs a `WARNING` message describing the invalid
operation invocation.

## Adding a Listener

### Explicitly Registering a Listener on a [`Tracer`](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.tracing/io/helidon/tracing/Tracer.html)

Create a `SpanListener` instance and invoke the
`Tracer#register(SpanListener)` method to make the listener known to
that tracer.

### Automatically Registering a Listener on all `Tracer` Instances

Helidon also uses Java service loading to locate listeners and register
them automatically on all `Tracer` objects. Follow these steps to add a
listener service provider.

1.  Implement the
    [`SpanListener`](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.tracing/io/helidon/tracing/SpanListener.html)
    interface.

2.  Declare your implementation as a service provider:

    1.  Create the file
        `META-INF/services/io.helidon.tracing.SpanListener` containing a
        line with the fully-qualified name of your class which
        implements `SpanListener`.

    2.  If your service has a `module-info.java` file add the following
        line to it:
        ```
        provides io.helidon.tracing.SpanListener with <your-implementation-class>;
        ```

The `SpanListener` interface declares default no-op implementations for
all the methods, so your listener can implement only the methods it
needs to.

Helidon invokes each listener’s methods in the following order:

| Method                                  | When invoked                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `starting(Span.Builder<?> spanBuilder)` | Just before a span is started from its builder.                                                                       |
| `started(Span span)`                    | Just after a span has started.                                                                                        |
| `activated(Span span, Scope scope)`     | After a span has been activated, creating a new scope. A given span might never be activated; it depends on the code. |
| `closed(Span span, Scope scope)`        | After a scope has been closed.                                                                                        |
| `ended(Span span)`                      | After a span has ended successfully.                                                                                  |
| `ended(Span span, Throwable t)`         | After a span has ended unsuccessfully.                                                                                |
