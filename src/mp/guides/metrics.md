This guide describes how to create a sample Helidon MicroProfile (MP)
project that can be used to run some basic examples using both built-in
and custom metrics with Helidon.

Verify Prerequisites:
```shell
java -version
mvn --version
docker --version
kubectl version
```

Setting JAVA_HOME:
```shell
# On Mac
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21`

# On Linux
# Use the appropriate path to your JDK
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-21
```

## Create a Sample Helidon MP Project

Use the Helidon MP Maven archetype to create a simple project that can
be used for the examples in this guide.

Run the Maven archetype:
```shell
mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -DarchetypeVersion=4.4.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.examples \
    -DartifactId=helidon-quickstart-mp \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp
```

## Using the Built-In Metrics

Helidon provides three built-in scopes of metrics: base, vendor, and
application. Here are the metric endpoints:

1.  `/metrics?scope=base` - Base metrics as specified by the
    MicroProfile Metrics specification

2.  `/metrics?scope=vendor` - Helidon-specific metrics

3.  `/metrics?scope=application` - Application-specific metrics data.

Applications can add their own custom scopes as well simply by
specifying a custom scope name when registering a metric.

> [!NOTE]
> The `/metrics` endpoint returns data for all scopes.

The built-in metrics fall into these categories:

1.  JVM behavior (in the base scope), and

2.  basic key performance indicators for request handling (in the vendor
    scope).

A later section describes the [key performance indicator
metrics](#basic-and-extended-kpi) in detail.

The following example demonstrates how to use the other built-in
metrics. All examples are executed from the root directory of your
project (helidon-quickstart-mp).

Build the application and then run it:
```shell
mvn package
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-mp.jar
```

> [!NOTE]
> Metrics output can be returned in either text format (the default), or
> JSON. The text format uses OpenMetrics (Prometheus) Text Format, see
> <https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#text-format-details>.

Verify the metrics endpoint in a new terminal window:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

Text response (partial):
```text
# HELP classloader_loadedClasses_count Displays the number of classes that are currently loaded in the Java virtual machine.
# TYPE classloader_loadedClasses_count gauge
classloader_loadedClasses_count{mp_scope="base",} 4878.0
# HELP classloader_unloadedClasses_total Displays the total number of classes unloaded since the Java virtual machine has started execution.
# TYPE classloader_unloadedClasses_total counter
classloader_unloadedClasses_total{mp_scope="base",} 0.0
# HELP classloader_loadedClasses_total Displays the total number of classes that have been loaded since the Java virtual machine has started execution.
# TYPE classloader_loadedClasses_total counter
classloader_loadedClasses_total{mp_scope="base",} 4878.0
# HELP vthreads_submitFailures Virtual thread submit failures since metrics start-up
# TYPE vthreads_submitFailures gauge
vthreads_submitFailures{mp_scope="base",} 0.0
# HELP vthreads_pinned Number of pinned virtual threads since metrics start-up
# TYPE vthreads_pinned gauge
vthreads_pinned{mp_scope="base",} 0.0
```

You can get the same data in JSON format.

Verify the metrics endpoint with an HTTP accept header:
```shell
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

JSON response (partial):
```json
{
  "application": {
    "personalizedGets": 0,
    "allGets": {
      "count": 0,
      "elapsedTime": 0,
      "max": 0,
      "mean": 0
    }
  },
  "vendor": {
    "requests.count": 2
  },
  "base": {
    "gc.total;name=G1 Concurrent GC": 2,
    "cpu.systemLoadAverage": 10.3388671875,
    "classloader.loadedClasses.count": 8224,
    "thread.count": 19,
    "vthreads.pinned": 0,
    "classloader.unloadedClasses.total": 0,
    "jvm.uptime": 36.8224,
    "vthreads.submitFailures": 0
  }
}
```

You can get a single metric by specifying the scope and name as query
parameters in the URL.

Get the Helidon `requests.count` metric:
```shell
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  'http://localhost:8080/metrics?scope=vendor&name=requests.count'
```

JSON response:
```json
{
  "requests.count": 6
}
```

The `base` metrics illustrated above provide some insight into the
behavior of the JVM in which the server runs.

The `vendor` metric shown above gives an idea of the request traffic the
server is handling. See the [later section](#basic-and-extended-kpi) for
more information on the basic and extended key performance indicator
metrics.

## Controlling Metrics Behavior

By adding a `metrics` section to your application configuration you can
control how the Helidon metrics subsystem behaves in any of several
ways.

- [Disable metrics subsystem entirely](#disabling-entirely).

- [Control `REST.request` metrics.](#controlling-rest-request-metrics)

- Select whether to collect [extended key performance indicator
  metrics](#basic-and-extended-kpi).

- Control reporting of [virtual threads metrics](#controlling-vthreads).

### Disabling Metrics Subsystem Entirely

You can disable the metrics subsystem entirely using configuration:

Configuration properties file disabling metrics:
```properties
metrics.enabled=false
```

With metrics processing disabled, Helidon never updates any metrics and
the `/metrics` endpoints respond with `404`.

### Collecting Basic and Extended Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Metrics

Any time you include the Helidon metrics module in your application,
Helidon tracks a basic performance indicator metric: a `Counter` of all
requests received (`requests.count`).

Helidon MP also includes additional, extended KPI metrics which are
disabled by default:

- current number of requests in-flight - a `Gauge` (`requests.inFlight`)
  of requests currently being processed

- long-running requests - a `Counter` (`requests.longRunning`) measuring
  the total number of requests which take at least a given amount of
  time to complete; configurable, defaults to 10000 milliseconds (10
  seconds)

- load - a `Counter` (`requests.load`) measuring the number of requests
  worked on (as opposed to received)

- deferred - a `Gauge` (`requests.deferred`) measuring delayed request
  processing (work on a request was delayed after Helidon received the
  request)

You can enable and control these metrics using configuration:

Configuration properties file controlling extended KPI metrics:
```properties
metrics.key-performance-indicators.extended = true
metrics.key-performance-indicators.long-running.threshold-ms = 2000
```

### Controlling Meters Related to Virtual Threads Behavior

Helidon optionally maintains several metrics related to virtual threads
as summarized in the next table. Helidon might rely on Java Flight
Recorder (JFR) events and JMX MBeans in computing the metric values. Be
aware that limitations or changes in the values provided by these
sources are outside the control of Helidon.

For performance reasons Helidon does not report virtual thread metrics
unless you enable them using configuration.

| Metric name             | Usage                                                                                | Source                                                         |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vthreads.count`        | Current number of active virtual threads.                                            | JFR `jdk.virtualThreadStart` and `jdk.virtualThreadEnd` events |
| `vthreads.pinned`       | Number of times virtual threads have been pinned.                                    | JFR `jdk.virtualThreadPinned` event                            |
| `vthreads.recentPinned` | Distribution of the duration of thread pinning. <sup>1</sup>                         | JFR `jdk.virtualThreadPinned` event                            |
| `vthreads.started`      | Number of virtual threads started.                                                   | JFR `jdk.virtualThreadStart` event                             |
| `vthreads.submitFailed` | Number of times submissions of a virtual thread to a platform carrier thread failed. | JFR `jdk.virtualThreadSubmitFailed` event                      |

Metrics for Virtual Threads:

<sup>1</sup> Distribution summaries can discard stale data, so the
`recentPinned` summary might not reflect all thread pinning activity.

### Configuring Virtual Threads Metrics

#### Enabling Virtual Threads Metrics

Gathering data to compute the metrics for virtual threads is designed to
be as efficient as possible, but doing so still imposes a load on the
server and by default Helidon does not report metrics related to virtual
threads.

To enable the metrics describing virtual threads include a config
setting as shown in the following example.

Enabling virtual thread metrics:
```properties
metrics.virtual-threads.enabled = true
```

#### Controlling Measurements of Pinned Virtual Threads

Helidon measures pinned virtual threads only when the thread is pinned
for a length of time at or above a threshold. Control the threshold as
shown in the example below.

Setting virtual thread pinning threshold to 100 ms:
```properties
metrics.virtual-threads.pinned.threshold=PT0.100S
```

The threshold value is a `Duration` string, such as `PT0.100S` for 100
milliseconds.

### Controlling `REST.request` Metrics

Helidon MP implements the optional family of metrics, all with the name
`REST.request`, as described in the [MicroProfile Metrics
specification](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-metrics-5.1.1/microprofile-metrics-spec-5.1.1.html#_optional_rest).
Each instance is a `Timer` with tags `class` and `method` identifying
exactly which REST endpoint Java method that instance measures.

By default, Helidon MP does *not* enable this feature. Enable it by
editing your application configuration to set
`metrics.rest-request.enabled` to `true`.

Note that the applications you generate using the full Helidon archetype
*do* enable this feature in the generated config file. You can see the
results in the sample output shown in earlier example runs.

## Metrics Metadata

Each metric has associated metadata that includes:

1.  name: The name of the metric.

2.  units: The unit of the metric such as time (seconds, milliseconds),
    size (bytes, megabytes), etc.

3.  a description of the metric.

You can get the metadata for any scope, such as `/metrics?scope=base`,
as shown below:

Get the metrics metadata using HTTP OPTIONS method:
```shell
 curl -X OPTIONS -H "Accept: application/json" 'http://localhost:8080/metrics?scope=base'
```

JSON response (truncated):
```json
{
   "classloader.loadedClasses.count": {
      "type": "gauge",
      "description": "Displays the number of classes that are currently loaded in the Java virtual machine."
    },
   "jvm.uptime": {
      "type": "gauge",
      "unit": "seconds",
      "description": "Displays the start time of the Java virtual machine in milliseconds. This attribute displays the approximate time when the Java virtual machine started."
    },
   "memory.usedHeap": {
      "type": "gauge",
      "unit": "bytes",
      "description": "Displays the amount of used heap memory in bytes."
    }
}
```

## Application-Specific Metrics Data

You can create application-specific metrics and integrate them with
Helidon using CDI. To add a new metric, simply annotate the JAX-RS
resource with one of the metric annotations. Metrics can be injected at
the class, method, and field-levels. This document shows examples of all
three.

Helidon will automatically create and register annotated application
metrics and store them in the application `MetricRegistry`, which also
contains the metric metadata. The metrics will exist for the lifetime of
the application. Each metric annotation has mandatory and optional
fields. The name field, for example, is optional.

### Method Level Metrics

There are two metrics that you can use by annotating a method:

1.  `@Counted` - Register a `Counter` metric
2.  `@Timed` - Register a `Timer` metric

The following example will demonstrate how to use the `@Counted`
annotation to track the number of times the `/cards` endpoint is called.

Create a new class `GreetingCards` with the following code:
```java
@Path("/cards") 
@RequestScoped 
public class GreetingCards {

    private static final JsonBuilderFactory JSON = Json.createBuilderFactory(Map.of());

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(name = "any-card")  
    public JsonObject anyCard() throws InterruptedException {
        return createResponse("Here are some random cards ...");
    }

    private JsonObject createResponse(String msg) {
        return JSON.createObjectBuilder().add("message", msg).build();
    }
}
```

- This class is annotated with `Path` which sets the path for this
  resource as `/cards`.

- The `@RequestScoped` annotation defines that this bean is request
  scoped. The request scope is active only for the duration of one web
  service invocation, and it is destroyed at the end of that invocation.

- The annotation `@Counted` will register a `Counter` metric for this
  method, creating it if needed. The counter is incremented each time
  the anyCards method is called. The `name` attribute is optional.

Build and run the application, then invoke the application endpoints
below:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  'http://localhost:8080/metrics?scope=application'
```

JSON response (partial):
```json
{
  "io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.GreetingCards.any-card":2 
}
```

- The any-card count is two, since you invoked the endpoint twice.

> [!NOTE]
> Notice the counter is fully qualified. You can remove the package
> prefix by using the `absolute=true` field in the `@Counted`
> annotation. You must use `absolute=false` for class-level annotations.

### Additional Method Level Metrics

The `@Timed` annotation can also be used with a method. For the
following example. you can just annotate the same method with `@Timed`.
These metrics collect significant information about the measured
methods, but at a cost of some overhead and more complicated output.

Note that when using multiple annotations on a method, you **must** give
the metrics different names as shown below.

Replace the `GreetingCards` class with the following code:
```java
@Path("/cards")
@RequestScoped
public class GreetingCards {

    private static final JsonBuilderFactory JSON = Json.createBuilderFactory(Map.of());

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(name = "cardCount", absolute = true) 
    @Timed(name = "cardTimer", absolute = true, unit = MetricUnits.MILLISECONDS) 
    public JsonObject anyCard() {
        return createResponse("Here are some random cards ...");
    }

    private JsonObject createResponse(String msg) {
        return JSON.createObjectBuilder().add("message", msg).build();
    }
}
```

- Specify a custom name for the `Counter` metric and set `absolute=true`
  to remove the path prefix from the name.

- Add the `@Timed` annotation to get a `Timer` metric.

Build and run the application, then invoke the application endpoints
below:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  'http://localhost:8080/metrics?scope=application'
```

JSON response (partial):
```json
{
  "cardTimer": {
    "count": 2,
    "max": 0.002921992,
    "mean": 0.0014682555,
    "elapsedTime": 0.002936511,
    "p0.5": 1.4336e-05,
    "p0.75": 0.003014144,
    "p0.95": 0.003014144,
    "p0.98": 0.003014144,
    "p0.99": 0.003014144,
    "p0.999": 0.003014144
  },
  "cardCount": 2
}
```

### Reusing Metrics

You can share a metric across multiple endpoints simply by specifying
the same metric annotation as demonstrated below.

Replace the `GreetingCards` class with the following code:
```java
@Path("/cards")
@RequestScoped
public class GreetingCards {

    private static final JsonBuilderFactory JSON = Json.createBuilderFactory(Map.of());

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(name = "anyCard", absolute = true)
    public JsonObject anyCard() throws InterruptedException {
        return createResponse("Here are some cards ...");
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/birthday")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(name = "specialEventCard", absolute = true)  
    public JsonObject birthdayCard() throws InterruptedException {
        return createResponse("Here are some birthday cards ...");
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/wedding")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(name = "specialEventCard", absolute = true)  
    public JsonObject weddingCard() throws InterruptedException {
        return createResponse("Here are some wedding cards ...");
    }

    private JsonObject createResponse(String msg) {
        return JSON.createObjectBuilder().add("message", msg).build();
    }
}
```
- 
- The `/birthday` endpoint uses a `Counter` metric, named
  `specialEventCard`.

- The `/wedding` endpoint uses the same `Counter` metric, named
  `specialEventCard`.

Build and run the application, then invoke the following endpoints:
```shell
curl  http://localhost:8080/cards/wedding
curl  http://localhost:8080/cards/birthday
curl  http://localhost:8080/cards
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  'http://localhost:8080/metrics?scope=application'
```

JSON response (partial):
```json
{
  "anyCard": 1,
  "specialEventCard": 2 
}
```

- Notice that `specialEventCard` count is two, since you accessed
  `/cards/wedding` and `/cards/birthday`.

### Class Level Metrics

You can collect metrics at the class-level to aggregate data from all
methods in that class using the same metric. The following example
introduces a metric to count all card queries. In the following example,
the method-level metrics are not needed to aggregate the counts, but
they are left in the example to demonstrate the combined output of all
three metrics.

Replace the `GreetingCards` class with the following code:
```java
@Path("/cards")
@RequestScoped
@Counted(name = "totalCards") 
public class GreetingCards {

    private static final JsonBuilderFactory JSON = Json.createBuilderFactory(Map.of());

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(absolute = true) 
    public JsonObject anyCard() throws InterruptedException {
        return createResponse("Here are some random cards ...");
    }

    @Path("/birthday")
    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(absolute = true) 
    public JsonObject birthdayCard() throws InterruptedException {
        return createResponse("Here are some birthday cards ...");
    }

    private JsonObject createResponse(String msg) {
        return JSON.createObjectBuilder().add("message", msg).build();
    }
}
```
- This class is annotated with `@Counted`, which aggregates count data
  from all the method that have a `Count` annotation.

- Use `absolute=true` to remove path prefix for method-level
  annotations.

- Add a method with a `Counter` metric to get birthday cards.

Build and run the application, then invoke the following endpoints:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl http://localhost:8080/cards/birthday
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  'http://localhost:8080/metrics?scope=application'
```

JSON response (partial):
```json
{
  "anyCard": 1,
  "birthdayCard": 1,
  "io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.totalCards.GreetingCards": 2 
}
```

- The `totalCards` count is a total of all the method-level `Counter`
  metrics. Class level metric names are always fully qualified.

### Field Level Metrics

Field level metrics can be injected into managed objects, but they need
to be updated by the application code. This annotation can be used on
fields of type `Timer`, `Counter`, and `Histogram`.

The following example shows how to use a field-level `Counter` metric to
track cache hits.

Replace the `GreetingCards` class with the following code:
```java
@Path("/cards")
@RequestScoped
@Counted(name = "totalCards")
public class GreetingCards {

    private static final JsonBuilderFactory JSON = Json.createBuilderFactory(Map.of());

    @Inject
    @Metric(name = "cacheHits", absolute = true) 
    private Counter cacheHits;

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(absolute = true)
    public JsonObject anyCard() throws InterruptedException {
        updateStats(); 
        return createResponse("Here are some random cards ...");
    }

    @Path("/birthday")
    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(absolute = true)
    public JsonObject birthdayCard() throws InterruptedException {
        updateStats();  
        return createResponse("Here are some birthday cards ...");
    }

    private JsonObject createResponse(String msg) {
        return JSON.createObjectBuilder().add("message", msg).build();
    }

    private void updateStats() {
        if (new Random().nextInt(3) == 1) {
            cacheHits.inc(); 
        }
    }
}
```
- A `Counter` metric field, `cacheHits`, is automatically injected by
  Helidon.

- Call `updateStats()` to update the cache hits.

- Call `updateStats()` to update the cache hits.

- Randomly increment the `cacheHits` counter.

Build and run the application, then invoke the following endpoints:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
curl http://localhost:8080/cards/birthday
curl http://localhost:8080/cards/birthday
curl http://localhost:8080/cards/birthday
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  'http://localhost:8080/metrics?scope=application'
```

JSON response (partial):
```json
{
  "anyCard": 2,
  "birthdayCard": 3,
  "cacheHits": 2, 
  "io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.totalCards.GreetingCards": 5
}
```

- The cache was hit two times out of five queries.

### Gauge Metric

The `Gauge` metric measures a value that is maintained by code outside
the metrics subsystem. As with other metrics, the application explicitly
registers a gauge. When the `/metrics` endpoint is invoked, Helidon
retrieves the value of each registered `Gauge`.

The following example demonstrates how to use a `Gauge` to track
application up-time.

Create a new `GreetingCardsAppMetrics` class with the following code:
```java
@ApplicationScoped 
public class GreetingCardsAppMetrics {

    private AtomicLong startTime = new AtomicLong(0); 

    public void onStartUp(@Observes @Initialized(ApplicationScoped.class) Object init) {
        startTime = new AtomicLong(System.currentTimeMillis()); 
    }

    @Gauge(unit = "TimeSeconds")
    public long appUpTimeSeconds() {
        return Duration.ofMillis(System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime.get()).getSeconds();  
    }
}
```

- This managed object must be application scoped to properly register
  and use the `Gauge` metric.

- Declare an `AtomicLong` field to hold the start time of the
  application.

- Initialize the application start time.

- Return the application `appUpTimeSeconds` metric, which will be
  included in the application metrics.

Update the `GreetingCards` class with the following code to simplify the
metrics output:

```java
@Path("/cards")
@RequestScoped
public class GreetingCards {

    private static final JsonBuilderFactory JSON = Json.createBuilderFactory(Map.of());

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Counted(name = "cardCount", absolute = true)
    public JsonObject anyCard() throws InterruptedException {
        return createResponse("Here are some random cards ...");
    }

    private JsonObject createResponse(String msg) {
        return JSON.createObjectBuilder().add("message", msg).build();
    }
}
```

Build and run the application, then invoke the application metrics
endpoint:

```shell
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  http://localhost:8080/metrics/application
```

JSON response from `/metrics/application`:
```json
{
  "cardCount": 0,
  "io.helidon.examples.quickstart.mp.GreetingCardsAppMetrics.appUpTimeSeconds": 6 
}
```

- The application has been running for 6 seconds.

## Integration with Kubernetes and Prometheus

### Kubernetes Integration

The following example shows how to integrate the Helidon MP application
with Kubernetes.

Stop the application and build the docker image:
```shell
docker build -t helidon-metrics-mp .
```

Create the Kubernetes YAML specification, named `metrics.yaml`, with the
following content:
```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: helidon-metrics 
  labels:
    app: helidon-metrics
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true" 
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: helidon-metrics
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      name: http
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: helidon-metrics
spec:
  replicas: 1 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helidon-metrics
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helidon-metrics
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helidon-metrics
          image: helidon-metrics-mp
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

- A service of type `NodePort` that serves the default routes on port
  `8080`.

- An annotation that will allow Prometheus to discover and scrape the
  application pod.

- A deployment with one replica of a pod.

Create and deploy the application into Kubernetes:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./metrics.yaml
```

Get the service information:
```shell
kubectl get service/helidon-metrics
```

```shell
NAME             TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
helidon-metrics   NodePort   10.99.159.2   <none>        8080:31143/TCP   8s 
```

- A service of type `NodePort` that serves the default routes on port
  `31143`.

Verify the metrics endpoint using port `30116`, your port will likely be
different:
```shell
curl http://localhost:31143/metrics
```

> [!NOTE]
> Leave the application running in Kubernetes since it will be used for
> Prometheus integration.

### Prometheus Integration

The metrics service that you just deployed into Kubernetes is already
annotated with `prometheus.io/scrape:`. This will allow Prometheus to
discover the service and scrape the metrics. This example shows how to
install Prometheus into Kubernetes, then verify that it discovered the
Helidon metrics in your application.

Install Prometheus and wait until the pod is ready:
```shell
helm install stable/prometheus --name metrics
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=server" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl get pod $POD_NAME
```

You will see output similar to the following. Repeat the
`kubectl get pod` command until you see `2/2` and `Running`. This may
take up to one minute.

```shell
metrics-prometheus-server-5fc5dc86cb-79lk4   2/2     Running   0          46s
```

Create a port-forward, so you can access the server URL:
```shell
kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 7090:9090
```

Now open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7090/targets`.
Search for helidon on the page, and you will see your Helidon
application as one of the Prometheus targets.

### Final Cleanup

You can now delete the Kubernetes resources that were just created
during this example.

Delete the Prometheus Kubernetes resources:
```shell
helm delete --purge metrics
```

Delete the application Kubernetes resources:
```shell
kubectl delete -f ./metrics.yaml
```

## Summary
