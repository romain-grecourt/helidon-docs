# Overview

Helidon implements [MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-3.0/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-spec-3.0.html)
specification which defines reactive operators and provides a
standardized tool for manipulation with [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/). You can use MicroProfile
Reactive Streams Operators when you want to maintain source-level
portability between different implementations.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable {feature-name}, either add a dependency on the
[helidon-microprofile
bundle](../../mp/introduction/microprofile.md)
or add the following dependency to your project’s `pom.xml` (see
[Managing Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.reactive-streams</groupId>
   <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-reactive-streams</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

The MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators specification provides a set
of operators within stages, as well as the builders used to prepare
graphs of stages from which streams can be built.

Example of simple closed graph usage:
```java
AtomicInteger sum = new AtomicInteger();

ReactiveStreams.of("1", "2", "3", "4", "5")
        .limit(3)
        .map(Integer::parseInt)
        .forEach(sum::addAndGet)
        .run()
        .whenComplete((r, t) -> System.out.println("Sum: " + sum.get()));

// >Sum: 6
```

Operators(Stages) {#terms}

## Graphs

[Graphs](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-3.0/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-spec-3.0.html#_graphs)
are pre-prepared stream builders with
[stages](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-3.0/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators-spec-3.0.html#_stages),
which can be combined to closed graph with methods `via` and `to`.

Combining the graphs and running the stream:
```java
// Assembly of stream, nothing is streamed yet
PublisherBuilder<String> publisherStage =
        ReactiveStreams.of("foo", "bar")
                .map(String::trim);

ProcessorBuilder<String, String> processorStage =
        ReactiveStreams.<String>builder()
                .map(String::toUpperCase);

SubscriberBuilder<String, Void> subscriberStage =
        ReactiveStreams.<String>builder()
                .map(s -> "Item received: " + s)
                .forEach(System.out::println);

// Execution of pre-prepared stream
publisherStage
        .via(processorStage)
        .to(subscriberStage).run();

// >Item received:FOO
// >Item received: BAR
```
