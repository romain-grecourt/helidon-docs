# Overview

Helidon MP comes with deep integration for three specification-defined,
broadly persistence-related technologies that can be used together or
separately:

- [Named data sources](#named-data-source-integration)
- [Jakarta Transactions (JTA)](#jakarta-transactions-jta-integration)
- [Jakarta Persistence (JPA)](#jakarta-persistence-jpa)

Each integration’s setup, configuration, and usage are described below.

# Named Data Source Integration

## Overview

Helidon MP’s named data source integration allows you to safely inject
managed [`javax.sql.DataSource`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html)
instances that are annotated with [`jakarta.inject.Named` annotations](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/dependency-injection/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/inject/named)
into your Helidon MP application. [`java.sql.Connection` objects](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.sql/java/sql/Connection.html) [acquired](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html#getConnection())
from these data sources will be pooled by your choice of one of two
possible connection pool implementations.

The connections managed by the connection pool will be supplied by your
relational database vendor’s JDBC driver.

How you set up Helidon MP’s named data source integration differs
depending on which of these two connection pools, which JDBC driver, and
which relational database product you use.

Representative setups are described below. This list of setups is not
exhaustive.

## Project Setup

### Setting Up a Connection Pool

#### Overview

Helidon MP’s named data source integration requires a connection pool
implementation.

Helidon MP comes with support for two connection pools:

1.  [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP)
2.  [Oracle Universal Connection Pool](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjucp/index.html)

You can choose to use either, but not both.

Details concerning each connection pool’s setup are described below.

#### Setting Up the HikariCP Connection Pool

##### Maven Coordinates (HikariCP)

To include the [HikariCP connection pool](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) in your Helidon MP
application:

- [Ensure your dependencies are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md)

- Ensure the following `<dependency>` element is present as a child
  element of your project’s `pom.xml` file’s `<dependencies>` element:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.cdi</groupId>
      <artifactId>helidon-integrations-cdi-datasource-hikaricp</artifactId>
      <scope>runtime</scope> 
  </dependency>
  ```

  - The `scope` is `runtime`, indicating that the HikariCP integration
    will be available on the runtime classpath.

#### Setting up the Oracle Universal Connection Pool

##### Maven Coordinates (Oracle Universal Connection Pool)

To include the [Oracle Universal Connection Pool](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjucp/index.html) in your Helidon MP application:

- [Ensure your dependencies are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md)

- Ensure the following `<dependency>` element is present as a child
  element of your project’s `pom.xml` file’s `<dependencies>` element:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.cdi</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-integrations-cdi-datasource-ucp</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope> 
  </dependency>
  ```

  - The `scope` is `runtime`, indicating that the Oracle Universal
    Connection Pool integration will be available on the runtime
    classpath.

### Setting Up a Database Driver

#### Overview

Regardless of which connection pool you use, at the lowest level, JDBC
database driver classes are what is ultimately responsible for making
any connections to a relational database. JDBC database driver classes
are database-product-specific.

Once you have decided upon a relational database product to use, and
JDBC driver classes to use to connect to it, [ensure your dependencies
are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md), and then ensure that a
`runtime`-scoped `<dependency>` element describing your JDBC driver
classes is present as a child element of your project’s `pom.xml` file’s
`<dependencies>` element.

See the [JDBC 4.3 Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.sql/java/sql/package-summary.html)
for more information about JDBC.

Representative setups are described below. This list of setups is not
exhaustive.

#### Setting Up H2

##### Maven Coordinates (H2)

To include the [H2 JDBC driver](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) classes in your
Helidon MP application so your application can [connect to an H2 database](https://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#database_url)
(whether in-memory or persistent):

- [Ensure your dependencies are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md)

- Ensure the following `<dependency>` element is present as a child
  element of your project’s `pom.xml` file’s `<dependencies>` element:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.db</groupId>
      <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
      <scope>runtime</scope> 
  </dependency>
  ```

  - The `scope` is `runtime`, indicating that the H2 JDBC driver classes
    will be available on the runtime classpath.

#### Setting Up Oracle JDBC

##### Maven Coordinates (Oracle JDBC)

To include the [Oracle JDBC driver classes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jajdb/index.html)
in your Helidon MP application so your application can [connect to an Oracle database](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjdbc/data-sources-and-URLs.html#GUID-EF07727C-50AB-4DCE-8EDC-57F0927FF61A):

- [Ensure your dependencies are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md)

- Read and understand [Developer’s Guide For Oracle JDBC 21c on Maven Central](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/maven-central-guide.html)

- For a basic setup, ensure the following `<dependency>` element is
  present as a child element of your project’s `pom.xml` file’s
  `<dependencies>` element:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.db</groupId>
      <artifactId>ojdbc</artifactId>
      <scope>runtime</scope> 
  </dependency>
  ```

  - The `scope` is `runtime`, indicating that the Oracle JDBC driver
    classes will be available on the runtime classpath.

## Configuration

### Overview

Each connection pool supported by Helidon’s named data source
integration support is, itself, a `DataSource` that wraps a
*vendor-supplied* `DataSource` present in the JDBC driver classes you
added to your project. You must configure both the pool and the
vendor-supplied `DataSource`.

To configure Helidon MP’s named data source integration:

1.  Decide where each property of the configuration will reside, as
    permitted by [Helidon MP’s MicroProfile Config implementation](config/introduction.md)

2.  Create configuration suitable for the combination of your selected
    connection pool and your selected vendor-supplied `DataSource`
    implementation in those locations

Helidon MP’s named data source integration relies on [Helidon MP’s usage
of MicroProfile Config](config/introduction.md), so you have many
choices for each configuration property when deciding on your
configuration’s location in (1) above.

The configuration property values themselves are necessarily specific to
the connection pool you selected, and to the vendor-supplied
`DataSource` responsible for actually connecting to your relational
database. In general, at a minimum, in your configuration you typically
supply:

- Information so the connection pool knows which vendor-supplied
  `DataSource` implementation to manage

- A JDBC URL specific to the vendor-supplied `DataSource` describing
  where the database is located, so the managed vendor-supplied
  `DataSource` knows how to connect to it

- Information required for the vendor-supplied `DataSource` to
  authenticate to the database and otherwise tailor itself to it

Some examples for representative configurations follow. This list of
configurations is not exhaustive.

### Configuration Prefixes

All MicroProfile Config-compatible property names for Helidon MP’s named
data source integration follow a common pattern:

***objecttype***.***datasourcename***.***propertyname***

- The name of a given configuration property always begins with the
  ***objecttype*** portion: a fully-qualified Java class name of the
  object being configured. Configuration for Helidon MP’s named data
  source integration concerns the behavior of `javax.sql.DataSource`
  objects, so Helidon MP’s named data source integration configuration
  property names begin with `javax.sql.DataSource`.

  - A period (`.`) separates the *objecttype* portion from the rest of
    the property name.

- The ***datasourcename*** portion, the name of the data source being
  configured, comes next. It cannot contain a period (`.`).

  - A period (`.`) separates the *datasourcename* portion from the rest
    of the property name.

- The ***propertyname*** portion, identifying the connection-pool- or
  vendor-supplied-`DataSource`-specific configuration property name,
  comes last. It may contain periods (`.`).

As an example, configuration to set an imaginary `foo.bar` property on
the `test` data source’s associated connection pool or vendor-specific
`DataSource` to `baz` looks like this in Java `.properties` format:

```properties
javax.sql.DataSource.test.foo.bar=baz
```

- The ***objecttype*** portion of the configuration property name is
  `javax.sql.DataSource`.

- The ***datasourcename*** portion of the configuration property name is
  `test`.

- The ***propertyname*** portion of the configuration property name is
  `foo.bar`.

### Examples

Here are some examples illustrating general named data source
configuration patterns in various [common MicroProfile Config-compatible
locations](config/advanced-configuration.md).

#### Example: `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` Classpath Resource

Here is an example of some named data source configuration as might be
found in a `src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
configuration source:

```properties
javax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.somePropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource = itsValue
javax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.someOtherPropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource = anotherValue
```

#### Example: System Properties Set on the Command Line

Here is an example of some named data source configuration using system
properties on the command line instead:

```shell
java \
  -Djavax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.somePropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource=itsValue \
  -Djavax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.someOtherPropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource=anotherValue \
  # ...
```

#### Example: Environment Variables Set on the Command Line

Here is an example of some named data source configuration using
environment variables as typed directly into a command line shell,
relying on [MicroProfile Config’s mapping
rules](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-config-3.1/apidocs/org/eclipse/microprofile/config/spi/ConfigSource.html#default_config_sources),
since many shells will not understand environment variable names with
periods (.) in them:

```shell
JAVAX_SQL_DATASOURCE_YOURDATASOURCENAME_SOMEPROPERTYOFYOURCONNECTIONPOOLANDDATASOURCE=itsValue \
JAVAX_SQL_DATASOURCE_YOURDATASOURCENAME_SOMEOTHERPROPERTYOFYOURCONNECTIONPOOLANDDATASOURCE=anotherValue \
java # ...
```

#### Example: Environment Variables Set By the `env` Command

Here is an example of some named data source configuration using
environment variables as supplied via the [`env` shell
command](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/env-invocation.html),
thus removing the need for [MicroProfile Config’s mapping
rules](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-config-3.1/apidocs/org/eclipse/microprofile/config/spi/ConfigSource.html#default_config_sources):

```shell
env 'javax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.somePropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource=itsValue' \
  'javax.sql.DataSource.yourDataSourceName.someOtherPropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource=anotherValue' \
  java # ...
```

#### Example: `application.yaml` Classpath Resource

Here is an example of some named data source configuration as might be
found in a `src/main/resources/application.yaml` classpath resource:

```yaml
javax:
  sql:
    DataSource:
      yourDataSourceName:
        somePropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource: itsValue
        someOtherPropertyOfYourConnectionPoolAndDataSource: anotherValue
```

#### Example: Configuring the Oracle Universal Connection Pool and Oracle JDBC

This example presumes you have:

- [set up the Oracle Universal Connection Pool](#setting-up-the-oracle-universal-connection-pool)
- [set up Oracle JDBC](#setting-up-oracle-jdbc)

This example, in Java properties file format, configures an Oracle
Universal Connection Pool-managed data source named `main` to [connect to an Oracle Database](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjdbc/data-sources-and-URLs.html#GUID-C4F2CA86-0F68-400C-95DA-30171C9FB8F0)
on `localhost` port `1521`, using the `oracle.jdbc.poolOracleDataSource`
vendor-supplied `DataSource`, with a service name of `XE`, a `user` of
`scott`, and a `password` of `tiger`:

```properties
javax.sql.DataSource.main.connectionFactoryClassName = oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource
javax.sql.DataSource.main.URL = jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/XE
javax.sql.DataSource.main.user = scott
javax.sql.DataSource.main.password = tiger
```

- Why `connectionFactoryClassName`? See
  [`PoolDataSourceImpl#setConnectionFactoryClassName(String)`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjuar/oracle/ucp/jdbc/PoolDataSourceImpl.html#setConnectionFactoryClassName_java_lang_String_)).

- See [Thin-style Service Name
  Syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjdbc/data-sources-and-URLs.html#GUID-EF07727C-50AB-4DCE-8EDC-57F0927FF61A).

In general, the properties that can be set on the Oracle Universal
Connection Pool can be inferred from the "setter" methods found in [the
javadoc for the `PoolDataSourceImpl`
class](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjuar/oracle/ucp/jdbc/PoolDataSourceImpl.html).

In general, the properties that can be set on the
[`oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jajdb/oracle/jdbc/pool/OracleDataSource.html)
`DataSource` implementation can be inferred from the "setter" methods
found in [its
javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jajdb/oracle/jdbc/pool/OracleDataSource.html).

> [!NOTE]
> [Unlike
> HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/blob/HikariCP-5.0.1/src/main/java/com/zaxxer/hikari/util/PropertyElf.java#L46-L53),
> the Oracle Universal Connection Pool does not distinguish cleanly
> between configuration properties that affect *its* behavior and those
> that affect the behavior of the vendor-supplied `DataSource`
> implementation whose connections it pools. For example, in the example
> above it is not possible to tell that [`connectionFactoryClassName` is
> a property of the Oracle Universal Connection
> Pool](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjuar/oracle/ucp/jdbc/PoolDataSourceImpl.html#setConnectionFactoryClassName_java_lang_String_),
> and [`user` is a property of the `oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource`
> `DataSource`
> implementation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jajdb/oracle/jdbc/datasource/impl/OracleDataSource.html#setUser_java_lang_String_).
> In some cases, the Oracle Universal Connection Pool will [set the
> given property on *both* the connection pool itself *and* on the
> vendor-supplied `DataSource` it
> manages](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjuar/oracle/ucp/jdbc/PoolDataSource.html#setUser_java_lang_String_).

#### Example: Configuring the HikariCP Connection Pool and H2

This example presumes you have:

- [set up the HikariCP connection pool](#setting-up-the-hikaricp-connection-pool)
- [set up H2](#setting-up-h2)

This example, in Java properties file format, configures a
HikariCP-managed data source named `test` to connect to an in-memory H2
database named `unit-testing` with a `user` of `sa` and an empty
password:

```properties
javax.sql.DataSource.test.dataSourceClassName = org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource
javax.sql.DataSource.test.dataSource.url = jdbc:h2:mem:unit-testing;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
javax.sql.DataSource.test.dataSource.user = sa
javax.sql.DataSource.test.dataSource.password =
```

- Why `dataSourceClassName`? See [HikariCP’s configuration
  documentation](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#essentials)
  for information about how HikariCP separates configuration of the
  connection pool itself from configuration of the vendor-supplied
  `DataSource`.

- Why `dataSource.`? See [`PropertyElf.java`, lines 47–49](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/blob/HikariCP-5.0.1/src/main/java/com/zaxxer/hikari/util.PropertyElf.java#L47-49).

- See [the H2 database’s documentation about its URL format](https://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#database_url).

HikariCP’s configuration properties are described [on its GitHub repository](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#gear-configuration-knobs-baby).
Properties that should be forwarded on to the vendor-supplied
`DataSource` [are prefixed with `dataSource.`](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/blob/HikariCP-5.0.1/src/main/java/com/zaxxer/hikari/util/PropertyElf.java#L46-L53)
as seen in the example above.

In general, the properties that can be set on the
[`org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource`](https://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/jdbcx/JdbcDataSource.html)
vendor-supplied `DataSource` can be inferred from the "setter" methods
found in [its javadoc](https://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/jdbcx/JdbcDataSource.html).

### Usage

You use Helidon MP’s named data source integration in the same way,
regardless of your choices of vendor-supplied `DataSource` and
connection pool.

To use Helidon MP’s named data source integration in your application,
once it has been [set up](#setting-up-a-connection-pool) and
[configured](#configuration), create an ordinary
[`DataSource`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html)-typed
injection point in a [Java class representing a CDI
bean](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-make-a-class-a-cdi-bean)
somewhere in your application, [annotated with the
name](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/dependency-injection/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/inject/named)
of the data source you wish to use.

Here is how to define such a field-backed injection point:

```java
@Inject 
@Named("test") 
private DataSource ds; 
```

- [`@Inject`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/dependency-injection/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/inject/inject)
  marks the field as an injection point. Its behavior is defined by the
  [Jakarta Dependency Injection
  specification](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/dependency-injection/2.0/jakarta-injection-spec-2.0.html).

- [`@Named("test")`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/dependency-injection/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/inject/named)
  says to use the data source named `test` (as declared by the
  [*datasourcename* portion](#configuration-prefixes) of a named data
  source configuration property).

- The field injection point has a type of
  [`javax.sql.DataSource`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html),
  and the field itself may be named anything you like.

Here is how to define such a constructor parameter injection point:

```java
private final DataSource ds; 

@Inject 
public SomeObject(@Named("test") DataSource ds) { 
    this.ds = ds; 
}
```

- This is the field whose value will be set in the constructor.

- [`@Inject`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/dependency-injection/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/inject/inject)
  marks the constructor as one containing parameter injection points.
  Its behavior is defined by the [Jakarta Dependency Injection specification](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/dependency-injection/2.0/jakarta-injection-spec-2.0.html).

- [`@Named("test")`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/dependency-injection/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/inject/named)
  says to use the data source named `test` (as declared by the
  [*datasourcename* portion](#configuration-prefixes) of a named data
  source configuration property). The parameter injection point has a
  type of
  [`javax.sql.DataSource`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html),
  and the parameter itself may be named anything you like.

- The injected argument will never be `null`.

# Jakarta Transactions (JTA) Integration

## Overview

Helidon MP’s Jakarta Transactions integration integrates the [Naryana transaction engine](https://www.narayana.io/), an implementation of the
[Jakarta Transactions Specification](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/2.0/),
into Helidon MP. It lets you use
[`@jakarta.transaction.Transactional`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/transaction/transactional)
to declare JTA transactions in your Java code.

## Maven Coordinates (JTA)

To include Helidon’s JTA integration in your application:

- [Ensure your dependencies are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md)

- Ensure the following `<dependency>` elements are present as child
  elements of your project’s `pom.xml` file’s `<dependencies>` element:

  ```xml
  <dependencies>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>jakarta.transaction</groupId>
          <artifactId>jakarta.transaction-api</artifactId>
          <scope>provided</scope> 
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.cdi</groupId>
          <artifactId>helidon-integrations-cdi-jta-weld</artifactId>
          <scope>runtime</scope> 
      </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ```

  - The `scope` is `provided`, which ensures that the [JTA classes
    required for
    compilation](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/transaction/transactional)
    are available at compile time.

  - The implementation of these API classes (provided by
    [Narayana](https://narayana.io/)) will be available at runtime.

## Configuration

### Overview

Helidon MP’s Jakarta Transactions integration does not require
configuration, but configuration is possible. Because configuration is
of the [underlying Narayana transaction engine](https://narayana.io/),
any restrictions are those of the engine, not of Helidon itself.

Narayana, unlike Helidon MP, does not use MicroProfile Config, so its
configuration options are less flexible.

Some common examples of Narayana configuration follow.

### Configuring the Object Store Directory

Narayana features an object store directory which it uses to store
information about transaction outcomes. To set its location, you may set
the
[`ObjectStoreEnvironmentBean.objectStoreDir`](https://www.narayana.io/docs/api/com/arjuna/ats/arjuna/common/ObjectStoreEnvironmentBean.html#setObjectStoreType-java.lang.String-)
system property to the full path of a writeable directory:

```shell
java -DObjectStoreEnvironmentBean.objectStoreDir=/var/tmp # ...
```

See [Specifying the object store
location](https://www.narayana.io/docs/project/index.html#d0e4013) for
more information.

### Configuring the Default Transaction Manager Timeout

To configure Narayana’s [default transaction manager
timeout](https://www.narayana.io/docs/api/com/arjuna/ats/arjuna/common/CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.html#setDefaultTimeout-int-),
set the `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.defaultTimeout` system
property to an integral value in seconds:

```shell
java -Dcom.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.defaultTimeout=60 # ...
```

For more on configuring Narayana, see [Setting
Properties](https://www.narayana.io/docs/project/index.html#chap-JBossJTA_Installation_Guide-Test_Chapter)
in the Naryana documentation.

## Usage

To use Helidon MP’s Jakarta Transactions integration, annotate a method
with the
[`jakarta.transaction.Transactional`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/transaction/transactional)
annotation:

```java
@Transactional 
public void setGreeting(Integer id) {
    // Do something transactional.
    greetingProvider.setMessage("Hello[" + id + "]"); 
}
```

- The [`@Transactional`
  annotation](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/transaction/transactional)
  indicates that this method should be invoked in the scope of a JTA
  transaction. **The object on which the method is invoked must be one
  that Helidon MP’s CDI container has created**, i.e. it must be
  managed. ([CDI beans are
  managed](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0.html#implementation),
  as are [Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource
  classes](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.1/jakarta-restful-ws-spec-3.1.html#resource-classes).)

- For
  [`@Transactional`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/2.0/apidocs/jakarta/transaction/transactional)
  to have any effect, whatever is used inside the method must be
  JTA-aware (such as a [Jakarta
  Persistence](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/)
  object like a managed
  [`EntityManager`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/entitymanager)).

# Jakarta Persistence (JPA)

## Overview

Helidon MP’s [Jakarta
Persistence](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/)
integration allows you to interact with Jakarta Persistence (JPA)
objects as if your code were running in an application server, handling
automatic creation and management of objects such as `EntityManager` and
`EntityManagerFactory` instances.

More pragmatically, it allows you to inject managed
[`EntityManager`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/entitymanager)
instances using the
[`@PersistenceContext`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/persistencecontext)
annotation.

Jakarta Persistence is a Jakarta EE specification that describes, among
other things, how its implementations:

1.  Map Java objects to relational database tables

2.  Manage such persistent Java objects

3.  Interact with [Jakarta Transactions](#jakarta-transactions-jta-integration)

4.  Interact with [named data sources](#named-data-source-integration)

Jakarta Persistence may be used in an entirely application-managed
manner, which requires no integration at all. This application-managed
mode places the burden of error handling, thread safety, transaction
management, and other concerns on the user. **This documentation does
*not* cover application-managed mode JPA.**

Jakarta Persistence may also (preferably) be used in a fully
container-managed manner, which requires that a container, like Helidon
MP, handle error management, thread safety and transaction management on
behalf of the user. **This documentation covers this container-managed
mode of JPA exclusively.**

Helidon MP’s Jakarta Persistence integration comes with support for two
JPA implementations, known as *JPA providers*:

1.  [Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/6.1)

2.  [Eclipselink](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/)

In any given project, you use one or the other, but not both.

How you set up Helidon MP’s Jakarta Persistence integration differs
depending on which of these JPA providers you choose to use.

Jakarta Persistence requires [Jakarta Transactions](#jakarta-transactions-jta-integration) and makes use
of [named data sources](#named-data-source-integration), so as you set up your project you will
need to understand:

- [Helidon MP’s named data source integration](#named-data-source-integration)

- [Helidon MP’s Jakarta Transactions integration](#jakarta-transactions-jta-integration)

## Project Setup

### Setting Up a JPA Provider

#### Overview

While the Jakarta Persistence specification standardizes many aspects
around programming and usage, it deliberately leaves many required setup
and configuration aspects up to the JPA provider. You will need to set
up your project differently depending on which JPA provider you choose.

To set up Helidon MP’s Jakarta Persistence integration in your
application to work with your chosen JPA provider, you must:

1.  [Set up and configure named data sources as appropriate](#named-data-source-integration)

2.  [Set up and configure Helidon MP’s Jakarta Transactions support](#jakarta-transactions-jta-integration)

3.  Include the proper Jakarta Persistence-related dependencies

4.  Set up your project to generate and compile the [static metamodel](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#a6933)

5.  Set up your project for *static weaving*

Details and examples for each supported JPA provider are below.

#### Maven Coordinates (Common)

To include the Jakarta Persistence APIs that you will need and to
include the core of Helidon’s Jakarta Persistence integration:

- [Ensure your dependencies are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md)

- [Ensure you have set up and configured named data sources as appropriate](#named-data-source-integration)

- [Ensure you have set up and configured Helidon MP’s Jakarta Transactions support](#jakarta-transactions-jta-integration)

- Ensure the following `<dependency>` elements are present as child
  elements of your project’s `pom.xml` file’s `<dependencies>` element:

  ```xml
  <dependencies>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>jakarta.persistence</groupId>
          <artifactId>jakarta.persistence-api</artifactId>
          <scope>provided</scope> 
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.cdi</groupId>
          <artifactId>helidon-integrations-cdi-jpa</artifactId>
          <scope>runtime</scope> 
      </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ```

  - The `scope` is `provided`, which ensures that the [JPA classes required for compilation](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/package-summary.html)
    are available at compile time.

  - The `scope` is `runtime`, which ensures that Helidon’s core,
    provider-independent Jakarta Persistence integration is available at
    runtime.

These `<dependency>` elements do not set up a JPA provider. See details
below for the JPA provider you have chosen to use.

#### Setting Up Static Metamodel Generation

To generate and compile the Jakarta Persistence static metamodel for
your application, regardless of whether you are using Hibernate ORM or
Eclipselink, [ensure your dependencies are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md), and then make sure the
`<plugin>` element in the following code snippet is present as a child
element of the `<pluginManagement><plugins>` element sequence as shown
below:

```xml
<pluginManagement>
    <plugins>

        <!-- ... -->

        <plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>default-compile</id>
                    <configuration>
                        <annotationProcessorPaths>
                            <annotationProcessorPath>
                                <groupId>org.hibernate.orm</groupId>
                                <artifactId>hibernate-jpamodelgen</artifactId> 
                                <version>${version.lib.hibernate}</version> 
                            </annotationProcessorPath>
                        </annotationProcessorPaths>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>

        <!-- ... -->

    </plugins>
</pluginManagement>
```

- This adds the `hibernate-jpamodelgen` jar, which contains a [Java annotation processor that generates the static metamodel source code](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.1/javadocs/org/hibernate/jpamodelgen/JPAMetaModelEntityProcessor.html),
  to the Java compiler’s annotation processor path so that it is active
  at compile time.

- Because your [dependencies are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md), this will resolve to the
  currently supported version of Hibernate ORM.

For more on the Hibernate ORM `hibernate-jpamodelgen` annotation
processor, see [Hibernate Metamodel Generator](https://hibernate.org/orm/tooling/#hibernate-metamodel-generator)
in Hibernate ORM’s documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> Many parts of Hibernate ORM’s documentation of this feature are
> outdated.

#### Maven Coordinates (Hibernate ORM)

To include Helidon’s Jakarta Persistence-related integration for
Hibernate ORM:

- [Ensure your dependencies are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md)
- [Ensure the basics of your JPA project are set up properly](#setting-up-a-jpa-provider)

- Ensure the following `<dependency>` elements are present as child
  elements of your project’s `pom.xml` file’s `<dependencies>` element:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.cdi</groupId>
      <artifactId>helidon-integrations-cdi-hibernate</artifactId>
      <scope>runtime</scope> 
  </dependency>
  ```

  - The `scope` is `runtime`, which ensures that Helidon MP’s Hibernate
    ORM integration is available at runtime.

#### Setting Up Static Weaving (Hibernate ORM)

Hibernate ORM can alter your classes' bytecode at build time to keep
track of changes made to objects participating in Jakarta Persistence
workflows.

To set up this required static weaving for Hibernate ORM, ensure that
the following `<plugin>` element is present as a child element of your
project’s `pom.xml` file’s `<plugins>` element:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.orm.tooling</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-enhance-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <!--
        Ideally, your plugin versions are managed via a
        <pluginManagement> element, which is why the <version> element
        is commented out below.  If, nevertheless, you opt for the
        explicit version, check
        https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.hibernate.orm/hibernate-enhance-maven-plugin
        for up-to-date versions, and make sure the version is the same
        as that of Hibernate ORM itself.
    -->
    <!-- <version>6.3.1.Final</version> -->
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>Statically enhance JPA entities for Hibernate</id>
            <phase>compile</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>enhance</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <failOnError>true</failOnError>
                <enableDirtyTracking>true</enableDirtyTracking>
                <enableLazyInitialization>true</enableLazyInitialization>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

For more on the `hibernate-enhance-maven-plugin` in particular, see [its
documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.1/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#tooling-maven).

For more on Hibernate ORM’s bytecode enhancement (weaving) in general,
see [Bytecode
Enhancement](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.1/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#BytecodeEnhancement)

Properties](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.1/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#configurations-bytecode-enhancement)
in Hibernate ORM’s documentation.

#### Maven Coordinates (Eclipselink)

To include Helidon’s Jakarta Persistence-related integration for
Eclipselink:

- [Ensure your dependencies are managed](../about/managing-dependencies.md)
- [Ensure the basics of your JPA project are set up properly](#setting-up-a-jpa-provider)

- Ensure the following `<dependency>` elements are present as child
  elements of your project’s `pom.xml` file’s `<dependencies>` element:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.cdi</groupId>
      <artifactId>helidon-integrations-cdi-eclipselink</artifactId>
      <scope>runtime</scope> 
  </dependency>
  ```

  - The `scope` is `runtime`, which ensures that Helidon MP’s
    Eclipselink integration is available at runtime.

#### Setting Up Static Weaving (Eclipselink)

Eclipselink can alter your classes' bytecode at build time to keep track
of changes made to objects participating in Jakarta Persistence
workflows.

To set up this required static weaving for Eclipselink, ensure that the
following `<plugin>` element is present as a child element of your
project’s `pom.xml` file’s `<plugins>` element:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.0</version> 
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>weave</id>
            <phase>process-classes</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>java</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration combine.self="override">
                <classpathScope>compile</classpathScope>
                <mainClass>org.eclipse.persistence.tools.weaving.jpa.StaticWeave</mainClass>
                <arguments>
                    <argument>-loglevel</argument>
                    <argument>INFO</argument>
                    <argument>-persistenceinfo</argument>
                    <argument>${project.build.outputDirectory}</argument>
                    <argument>${project.build.outputDirectory}</argument>
                    <argument>${project.build.outputDirectory}</argument>
                </arguments>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

- Always check [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.codehaus.mojo/exec-maven-plugin)
  for up-to-date versions.

For more on the Eclipselink static weaving command-line utility, see
[Static Weaving](https://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/UserGuide/JPA/Advanced_JPA_Development/Performance/Weaving/Static_Weaving#Use_the_Command_Line)
in the Eclipselink documentation.

## Configuration

To configure Helidon MP’s Jakarta Persistence integration, you author a
[`META-INF/persistence.xml`file](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#persistence-xml-file).
It contains a mix of standardized elements and JPA provider-specific
properties.

If you are writing a component or a library, then you place this in your
Maven project’s `src/test/resources` directory (because a library or
component is not itself an application, and by definition can be
included in many applications, so it is inappropriate to put
application-level configuration in your component). If you are working
on a project that contains the `main` method (or similar) that starts
your application, then and only then do you place a
`META-INF/persistence.xml` in your persistence-oriented Maven project’s
`src/main/resources` directory.

For details about the structure and syntax of the
`META-INF/persistence.xml` file, see [persistence.xml file](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#persistence-xml-file)
in the Jakarta Persistence specification.

### Use Only One `META-INF/persistence.xml` Per Application

Like any configuration, a `META-INF/persistence.xml` file is normally an
*application-level* concern, not a *component-level* concern. In other
words, your Java application, made up of various components, or
libraries, some of which you may have written, and many of which you
have not, should normally have exactly one `META-INF/persistence.xml` on
its classpath, describing the persistence-related aspects of the
application in its particular environment. There are very few use cases
where multiple `META-INF/persistence.xml` classpath resources are called
for.

A common mistake is to write a component or library, by definition
intended for use in possibly more than one application, and include a
`src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml` in its Maven project. If
two components or libraries containing `META-INF/persistence.xml`
classpath resources like this are deployed as part of an application, it
can make for a confusing state of affairs at application runtime, and
may lead to exceptions indicating more *persistence units* are present
than are expected.

Most library projects that work with JPA artifacts should probably have
a `src/test/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml` in their Maven projects
instead. This allows you to test your JPA-centric work against a test
configuration, rather than a "main" or production one, which is almost
certainly what you want in nearly all cases.

### Persistence Units

Fundamentally, a `META-INF/persistence.xml` file contains a collection
of *persistence units*. A persistence unit represents a collection of
entities in a relational database loosely coupled to a [named data
source](#named-data-source-integration) that knows how to connect to it.

Your `META-INF/persistence.xml` file must begin (and end) with the
following XML:
```xml
<persistence xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence
                                 https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_1.xsd"
             version="3.1">
</persistence>
```

- Helidon MP’s Jakarta Persistence integration supports [Jakarta Persistence version 3.1](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/).
- `<persistence-unit>` elements are listed here.

### Persistence Unit

You list your application’s persistence units as `<persistence-unit>`
child elements of the enclosing `<persistence>` element. Each
`<persistence-unit>` element identifies a named persistence unit that
will correspond to an `EntityManager` in your code, and represents a
collection of entities in a relational database.

#### Example: Persistence Unit Skeleton

Here is a partial example of a persistence unit named `test` with a
helpful description:
```xml
<persistence-unit name="test" transaction-type="JTA"> 
    <description>A testing database</description>
</persistence-unit>
```

- Because Helidon MP’s JPA integration is for container-managed JPA, the
  [`transaction-type`attribute](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#a12296)
  must in practice always be set to `JTA`.

- The order of subsequent child elements is significant and governed by
  the [XML schema](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#persistence-xml-schema).

> [!NOTE]
> In most microservices, there will be only one persistence unit.

> [!TIP]
> A `<persistence-unit>` is represented in Jakarta Persistence as an
> instance of the
> [`PersistenceUnitInfo`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/spi/persistenceunitinfo)
> class.

#### JTA Data Source

A persistence unit is always associated with exactly one [named data source](#named-data-source-integration).

Because Helidon MP’s Jakarta Persistence integration provides support
for container-managed JPA, and because container-managed JPA requires
Jakarta Transactions (JTA), the kind of named data source a persistence
unit is associated with is always a [JTA](#jakarta-transactions-jta-integration) data source. The
`<jta-data-source>` element, a child of the `<persistence-unit>`
element, is how you link a persistence unit to a [named data source](#named-data-source-integration) you previously [configured](#configuration).

##### Example: Persistence Unit with JTA Data Source

Here is a partial example of a persistence unit named `test`, with a
helpful description, linked with a JTA data source named `main`:
```xml
<persistence-unit name="test" transaction-type="JTA">
    <description>A testing database</description>
    <jta-data-source>main</jta-data-source>
</persistence-unit>
```

- This links this persistence unit to a [data source](#named-data-source-integration) named `main`,
  whose [connectivity information](#configuration) can be found in a
  MicroProfile-Config-compatible location, as detailed in the [data source configuration](#configuration) section above.

- Other persistence unit characteristics go here.

#### Classes

A persistence unit lists the classes that should be managed and that
will take part in Jakarta Persistence workflows. You must list:

1.  [Entity classes](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#a18)
2.  [Embeddable classes](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#a487)
3.  [Mapped superclasses](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#mapped-superclasses)
4.  [Converter classes](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#a2999)

You use a [sequence of `<class>`elements](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#list-of-managed-classes)
to do this. Each `<class>` element contains the fully-qualified class
name of one of the types of managed classes listed above.

> [!NOTE]
> There are [other mechanisms that can be used in a
> `META-INF/persistence.xml` file to describe managed
> classes](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#a12305),
> but they may or may not be honored by a given JPA provider.

##### Example: Persistence Unit with Class Elements

Here is a partial example of a persistence unit named `test`, with a
helpful description, linked with a JTA data source named `main`,
containing two entity classes:
```xml
<persistence-unit name="test" transaction-type="JTA">
    <description>A testing database</description>
    <jta-data-source>main</jta-data-source>
    <class>com.example.ExampleEntity0</class> 
    <class>com.example.ExampleEntity1</class>
</persistence-unit>
```

- Each entity class is listed with a separate `<class>` element, and
  there is no containing `<classes>` element or similar.

- Other persistence unit characteristics go here.

#### Properties

Persistence units can have simple properties attached to them to further
configure the backing JPA provider. You use the [`<properties>`
element](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#a12384)
to specify them.

> [!NOTE]
> Helidon MP’s Jakarta Persistence integration is for container-managed
> JPA, so the vendor-independent properties [described in the
> specification](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#a12384)
> directly concerned with database connectivity information, such as
> `jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url`, **do not apply** and will be ignored
> if present.

##### Example: Persistence Unit with Properties

Here is a partial example of a persistence unit named `test`, with a
helpful description, linked with a JTA data source named `sample`,
containing two entity classes, configuring a Hibernate ORM-specific
property:
```xml
<persistence-unit name="test" transaction-type="JTA">
    <description>A testing database</description>
    <jta-data-source>sample</jta-data-source> 
    <class>com.example.ExampleEntity0</class>
    <class>com.example.ExampleEntity1</class>
    <properties>
        <property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true"/> 
        <property name="eclipselink.weaving" value="false"/> 
    </properties>
</persistence-unit>
```

- The name identifies a name present in the [*datasourcename* portion of
  a named datasource configuration](#configuration-prefixes). There
  is no need for any kind of reserved prefix (like `java:comp/env`).

- This is a Hibernate ORM-specific property and will be properly ignored
  if the JPA provider you have [set up](#setting-up-a-jpa-provider) is Eclipselink. See
  [Statement logging and statistics](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.1/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#configurations-logging)
  in the Hibernate ORM documentation for more details about the
  `hibernate.show_sql` property.

- This is an Eclipselink-specific property (and (a) is required and (b)
  must be set to `false` if you are using Eclipselink), and will be
  properly ignored if the JPA provider you have [set up](#setting-up-a-jpa-provider) is
  Hibernate ORM. See [weaving](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/4.0.2/jpa/extensions/persistenceproperties_ref.htm#weaving)
  in the Eclipselink documentation for more details about the
  `eclipselink.weaving` property.

> [!TIP]
> For an exhaustive list of Hibernate ORM-specific properties, see
> [Configurations](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.1/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#configurations)
> in the Hibernate ORM documentation.

## Usage

To use Helidon MP’s Jakarta Persistence integration, once you have [set
up](#setting-up-a-jpa-provider) and [configured](#configuration) your project, you
use the Jakarta Persistence APIs in almost the same manner as if your
project were deployed to a Jakarta EE application server.

Specifically, you:

1.  Annotate your managed classes (entities, mapped superclasses, etc.)
    appropriately (using[`@Entity`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/entity) and similar annotations)

2.  Inject
    [`EntityManager`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/entitymanager) instances appropriately with the [`@PersistenceContext` annotation](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/persistencecontext)

3.  Use an injected [`EntityManager`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/entitymanager) to work with your managed objects

In addition, you [use Helidon MP’s JTA integration](#usage) to
declare transactional boundaries where appropriate.

A full tutorial of Jakarta Persistence is *well* beyond the scope of
this documentation. Consult [the specification](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/jakarta-persistence-spec-3.1.html#entities)
for details on how to map your entity classes to relational database
tables, and how to perform other related tasks.
