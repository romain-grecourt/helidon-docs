# Overview

Helidon 4 has been written from the ground up to take full advantage of
Java 21’s virtual threads. With this new architecture, threads are no
longer a scarce resource that need to be pooled and managed, instead
they are an abundant resource that can be created as needed to satisfy
your application needs.

In most cases, users do not need to worry about thread management and
are able to run any type of task on virtual threads provided by the
Helidon Webserver. However, there are certain use cases where tasks may
need to be executed on platform threads: these include cpu-intensive
tasks as well as tasks that may pin a virtual thread to a platform
thread due to the use of synchronized blocks. Many libraries that are
typically used in Helidon applications have been updated to take full
advantage of virtual threads by avoiding unwanted synchronization
blocks, yet this process is still underway and some legacy libraries may
never be fully converted.

Helidon MP supports a new `@ExecuteOn` annotation to give developers
full control on how to run tasks. This annotation can be applied to any
CDI bean method to control the type of thread in which invocations of
that method shall execute on. If such a method returns `CompletionStage`
or `CompletableFuture`, it is assumed to be asynchronous and shall
execute in a new thread but without blocking the caller’s thread.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable ExecuteOn, add the following dependency to your project’s
`pom.xml` (see [Managing
Dependencies](../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-cdi</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# API

The API consists of a single `@ExecuteOn` annotation (with a few
parameters) that can be applied to any CDI bean method.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is based on CDI interceptors, so using it on a non-CDI
> bean method will have no effect.

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| Name | Value | Description |
| value | ThreadType.PLATFORM, ThreadType.VIRTUAL, ThreadType.EXECUTOR | Type of thread used to execute a method invocation |
| timeout | A long value | Maximum wait time for the method to return a value before triggering a timeout exception |
| unit | A `TimeUnit` value | Unit for `timeout` parameter |
| executorName | The name of an executor from which to obtain a thread | CDI producer with a `@Named` qualifier to access the executor |

# Configuration

The implementation of the `@ExecuteOn` annotation takes advantage of
Helidon’s `ThreadPoolSupplier` to (lazily) create a pool of platform
threads. The default configuration for this thread pool can be
overridden using the (root) config key `execute-on.platform` as shown in
the example below.

```yaml
execute-on:
  platform:
    thread-name-prefix: "my-platform-thread"
    core-pool-size: 1
    max-pool-size: 2
    queue-capacity: 10
```

For more information see the Javadoc for
[io.helidon.common.configurable.ThreadPoolSupplier](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.common.configurable/io/helidon/common/configurable/ThreadPoolSupplier.html).
For virtual threads, only the thread name prefix can be overridden as
follows:

```yaml
execute-on:
  virtual:
    thread-name-prefix: "my-virtual-thread"
```

# Examples

1.  The following example creates a new platform thread from a
    (configurable) default pool to execute a cpu-intensive task.
    Platform threads are a scarce resource, creating threads of type
    `PLATFORM` should be done responsibly!

    ```java
    public class MyPlaformBean {

        @ExecuteOn(ThreadType.PLATFORM)
        int cpuIntensive(int n) {
            return PiDigitCalculator.nthDigitOfPi(n);
        }
    }
    ```

2.  The next example also uses a platform thread, but this time the
    developer is also responsible for providing an executor; this is
    done by creating a CDI provider with the same executor name (using
    the `@Named` annotation) as the one in the annotation parameter.
    Note that for simplicity the producer in this example is also part
    of the same bean, but that is not a requirement in CDI.

    ```java
    public class MyExecutorBean {

        @ExecuteOn(value = ThreadType.EXECUTOR, executorName = "my-executor")
        int cpuIntensive(int n) {
            return PiDigitCalculator.nthDigitOfPi(n);
        }

        @Produces
        @Named("my-executor")
        ExecutorService myExecutor() {
            return Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        }
    }
    ```

3.  It is also possible to explicitly execute a method in a virtual
    thread, blocking the caller’s thread until the method execution is
    complete.

    ```java
    public class MyVirtualBean {

        @ExecuteOn(ThreadType.VIRTUAL)
        void someTask() {
            // run task on virtual thread
        }
    }
    ```

4.  Finally, a method can be executed in another thread but without
    blocking the caller’s thread. This behavior is triggered
    automatically when the bean method returns `CompletionStage` or
    `CompletableFuture`.

    ```java
    public class MyVirtualBeanAsync {

        @ExecuteOn(ThreadType.VIRTUAL)
        CompletionStage<String> someTask() {
            // run task on virtual thread without blocking caller
            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture("DONE");
        }
    }
    ```
