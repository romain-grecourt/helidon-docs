# Overview

Helidon supports MicroProfile REST Client metrics by registering metrics
automatically when developers add MicroProfile Metrics annotations to
REST client interfaces and methods.

MicroProfile neither mandates nor specifies how metrics and the REST
client work together. Support in Helidon for metrics on REST clients
uses the MicroProfile Metrics spec for inspiration where appropriate.

For more information about support for REST clients in Helidon see [REST Client](restclient.md).

# Maven Coordinates

To enable MicroProfile Rest Client Metrics, either add a dependency on
the [helidon-microprofile
bundle](../introduction/microprofile.md)
or add the following dependency to your project’s `pom.xml` (see
[Managing Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.rest-client-metrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-rest-client-metrics</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

Add the MicroProfile Metrics `@Counted` and `@Timed` annotations to REST
client interfaces and interface methods to trigger counting or timing,
respectively, of REST client method invocations.

Helidon determines metric names according to the [MicroProfile Metrics
naming
convention](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-metrics-5.1.1/microprofile-metrics-spec-5.1.1.html#annotated-naming-convention)
and supports the following metrics naming features:

- absolute and relative names

- explicit and inferred names

- type-level annotations

When you place annotations at the type level of a REST client interface
Helidon registers *different* metrics for each of the REST methods on
the interface. This is the same behavior as in normal MicroProfile
Metrics when you add metrics annotations at the type level.

When you use the annotations at the type level on a superinterface
Helidon acts as if those annotations appear at the type-level of any
REST client subinterface which extends the superinterface. In keeping
with the naming conventions enforced by the MicroProfile Metrics TCK,
relative metric names use the *subinterface* name not the declaring
interface name.

(Note that the MicroProfile Metrics specification states that the
*declaring* class name is used, while as written the MicroProfile
Metrics TCK requires that implementations use the *subclass* name. For
consistency the Helidon REST client metrics implementation follows the
enforced metrics TCK behavior.)

## Understanding How and When Helidon Registers REST Client Metrics

Helidon registers the metrics associated with a REST client interface
when that interface becomes known to Helidon as a REST client.

The [MicroProfile REST Client spec](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-rest-client-3.0/microprofile-rest-client-spec-3.0.html#_microprofile_rest_client)
describes how your application can inject a REST client interface or
prepare it programmatically. Either action makes the REST client known
to Helidon, at which time Helidon registers the metrics associated with
that interface’s methods. As a result, depending on how your application
works, REST client metrics might be registered well after your code
initially starts up.

## Using REST Client Metrics in Standalone Clients vs. in Servers

Helidon registers and updates REST client metrics whether the REST
client is standalone or is embedded in a Helidon server.

Helidon *does not* provide a `/metrics` endpoint for standalone clients,
nor does it provide any built-in way to transmit metrics data from a
client to a backend system. If needed, you can write your client code to
access the application `MetricRegistry` and retrieve the REST client
metrics Helidon has registered.

In contrast, when REST clients run inside Helidon servers the REST
client metrics for REST clients known to Helidon appear in the
`/metrics` output.

## Turning on Logging

Set `io.helidon.microprofile.restclientmetrics.level=DEBUG` in your
logging settings to see some of the inner workings of the REST client
metrics implementation.

During start-up the logging reports analysis of candidate REST client
interfaces and the creation of metric registration entries, including
the metric annotation and where Helidon found each.

When a REST client is made known to Helidon the logging reports the
actual registration of the metrics derived from that REST client
interface.

# API

Use the following annotations from
`org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.annotation` listed in the following
table to trigger REST client metrics.

|            |                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Annotation | Description                                     |
| `@Counted` | Counts the invocations of a REST client method. |
| `@Timed`   | Times the invocations of a REST client method.  |

Type-level annotations trigger registration of separate metrics for each
REST client method in the REST client interface.

# Configuration

Optional configuration options:

| key       | type   | default value | description                         |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| `enabled` | string | `true`        | Whether to use REST client metrics. |

The `enabled` configuration setting allows developers to build REST
client metrics into an application while permitting end users to disable
the feature at their discretion.

# Examples

This example is similar to the [Helidon REST Client doc example](restclient.md#examples)
which starts with the [Helidon MP QuickStart example](../guides/quickstart.md).

This sample app adds a new resource which mimics the functionality of
the `GreetResource` but delegates each incoming request to its
counterpart on the `GreetResource` using a REST client interface for
that `GreetResource`. In short, the example application delegates to
itself. Of course no production application would operate this way, but
this contrived situation helps illustrate how to use REST client metrics
simply with a single runnable project.

To create this REST client metrics example follow these steps.

1.  Starting with the Helidon MP QuickStart example, add dependencies
    for both the Helidon REST client component and the Helidon REST
    client metrics component, as shown below.

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.rest-client</groupId>
        <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-rest-client</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.rest-client-metrics</groupId>
        <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-rest-client-metrics</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

2.  Add the following REST client interface which includes MicroProfile
    Metrics annotations to count and time various REST client method
    invocations.

    ```java
    @Path("/greet")
    @Timed(name = "timedGreet", absolute = true)
    public interface GreetRestClient {

        @Counted
        @GET
        @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        GreetingMessage getDefaultMessage();

        @Path("/{name}")
        @GET
        @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        GreetingMessage getMessage(@PathParam("name") String name);

        @Path("/greeting")
        @PUT
        @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        Response updateGreeting(GreetingMessage message);
    }
    ```

    - Times all outbound method invocations using separate timers for
      each method.

    - Counts the number of times a request is sent to get the default
      greeting message.

3.  Add a new resource class, similar to the `GreetService` resource
    class, but which delegates all incoming requests using the REST
    client.

    ```java
    @Path("/delegate")
    public class DelegatingResource {

        private static LazyValue<GreetRestClient> greetRestClient = LazyValue.create(DelegatingResource::prepareClient);

        /**
         * Return a worldly greeting message.
         *
         * @return {@link GreetingMessage}
         */
        @GET
        @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        public GreetingMessage getDefaultMessage() {
            return greetRestClient.get().getDefaultMessage();
        }

        /**
         * Return a greeting message using the name that was provided.
         *
         * @param name the name to greet
         * @return {@link GreetingMessage}
         */
        @Path("/{name}")
        @GET
        @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        public GreetingMessage getMessage(@PathParam("name") String name) {
            return greetRestClient.get().getMessage(name);
        }

        /**
         * Set the greeting to use in future messages.
         *
         * @param message JSON containing the new greeting
         * @return {@link jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response}
         */
        @Path("/greeting")
        @PUT
        @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        public Response updateGreeting(GreetingMessage message) {
            return greetRestClient.get().updateGreeting(message);
        }

        private static GreetRestClient prepareClient() {
            Config config = ConfigProvider.getConfig();
            String serverHost = config.getOptionalValue("server.host", String.class).orElse("localhost");
            String serverPort = config.getOptionalValue("server.port", String.class).orElse("8080");
            return RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
                    .baseUri(URI.create("http://" + serverHost + ":" + serverPort))
                    .build(GreetRestClient.class);
        }
    }
    ```

    - Holds the prepared REST client for use by the delegating methods.

    - Prepares the REST client. The example shows only one of many ways
      of doing this step.

    - Each delegating method invokes the corresponding REST client
      method and returns the result from it.

      By default, resource classes such as `DelegatingResource` are
      instantiated for each incoming request, but generally a Helidon
      server making outbound requests reuses the client data structures
      and connections. To create and reuse only a single REST client
      instance this example resource uses the Helidon `LazyValue`
      utility class so even as the system creates multiple instances of
      `DelegatingResource` they all reuse the same REST client.

4.  Build and run the application.

    ```shell
    mvn clean package
    java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-mp.jar
    ```

5.  Access the delegating endpoints.

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/delegate
    curl http://localhost:8080/delegate
    curl http://localhost:8080/delegate/Joe
    ```

6.  Retrieve the application metrics for the `getDefaultMessage`
    operation.

    ```shell
    curl 'http://localhost:8080/metrics?scope=application' | grep getDefault
    ```

7.  Look for two types of metrics:

    1.  Counter:

        ```list
        # TYPE io_helidon_examples_quickstart_mp_GreetRestClient_getDefaultMessage_total counter
        io_helidon_examples_quickstart_mp_GreetRestClient_getDefaultMessage_total{mp_scope="application",} 2.0
        ```

        This is the counter resulting from the `@Counted` annotation on
        the `getDefaultMessage` method of the REST client interface. The
        name is relative to the annotated method’s class and is
        automatically set to the method name because neither `name` nor
        `absolute` were specified with the annotation.

    2.  Timer:

        ```list
        # TYPE timedGreet_getDefaultMessage_seconds summary
        timedGreet_getDefaultMessage_seconds{mp_scope="application",quantile="0.5",} 0.003407872
        timedGreet_getDefaultMessage_seconds{mp_scope="application",quantile="0.75",} 0.092143616
        timedGreet_getDefaultMessage_seconds_count{mp_scope="application",} 2.0
        ```

        This excerpt shows the output for only one timer, but the full
        output includes timers for each method.

        The `@Timed` annotation at the type level triggers the
        registration of timers for each REST method in the REST client
        interface. The `name` setting overrides the default of the type
        name, and the `absolute` setting means the selected name *is
        not* relative to the fully-qualified class name.
