# Overview

The Jakarta REST Client defines a programmatic API to access REST
resources. This API sits at a higher level than traditional HTTP client
APIs and provides full integration with server-side API concepts like
providers. It differs from the [Rest Client
API](../restclient/restclient.md) in that it does not support
annotations or proxies, but instead uses builders and a fluent API to
create and execute requests.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable Jakarta REST Client, add the following dependency to your
project’s `pom.xml` (see [Managing
Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
 <dependency>
     <groupId>io.helidon.jersey</groupId>
     <artifactId>helidon-jersey-client</artifactId>
 </dependency>
```

# API

Bootstrapping the API is done by obtaining an instance of `Client`. A
single instance of this class can be used to create multiple service
requests that share the same basic configuration, e.g., the same set of
*providers*. More precisely, from a `Client` we can create multiple
`WebTarget` s, and in turn, from each `WebTarget` we can create multiple
`Invocation` s.

```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
Response res = client
        .target("http://localhost:8080/greet")
        .request("text/plain")
        .get();
```

In the snippet above, the call to `target` returns a `WebTarget`, and
the call to `request` returns an `Invocation.Builder`; finally, the call
to `get` returns the `Response` that results from accessing the remote
resource.

Given that this API is fully integrated with message body readers and
writers, it is possible to request the response body be provided after
conversion to a Java type, such as a `String` in the example below.

```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
String res = client
        .target("http://localhost:8080/greet")
        .request("text/plain")
        .get(String.class);
```

Alternatively, there are also methods in `Response` that can trigger
similar conversions.

Configuration can be specified at the `Client` or `WebTarget` level, as
both types implement `Configurable<T>`. This enables common
configuration to be inherited by a `WebTarget` created from a `Client`
instance. In either case, several `register` methods can be used to
configure providers such as filters and exception mappers.

```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
client.register(GreetFilter.class);
String res = client
        .target("http://localhost:8080/greet")
        .register(GreetExceptionMapper.class)
        .request("text/plain")
        .get(String.class);
```

The example above shows registration of `GreetFilter.class` for all
targets and registration of `GreetExceptionMapper.class` for just one of
them. The same logic applies to other types of configuration such as
properties and features.

The Jakarta REST Client API has support for asynchronous invocations.
Accessing a resource asynchronously prevents the calling thread from
blocking for the duration of the call. By default, all invocations are
*synchronous* but can be turned into either asynchronous or reactive
calls by simply inserting the corresponding fluent method call during
the creation phase.

Using `Future`:

```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
Future<String> res = client
        .target("http://localhost:8080/greet")
        .request("text/plain")
        .async()        // now asynchronous
        .get(String.class);
```

Or using a more modern, reactive style:

```java
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
CompletionStage<String> res = client
        .target("http://localhost:8080/greet")
        .request("text/plain")
        .rx()           // now reactive
        .get(String.class);
```

In either case, the implementation will ensure the calling thread is not
blocked and that the result from the invocation is available upon
request or via a callback mechanism.

# Configuration

Configuration for this API is all done programmatically as shown in the
previous sections.
