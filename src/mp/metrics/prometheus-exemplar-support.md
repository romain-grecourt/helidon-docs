# Overview

A meter typically reflects the usage of a *single* point in your service
which processes *multiple* requests over time. A value such as the total
time consumed by a given REST endpoint which can be invoked multiple
times underscores the aggregate nature of meter values; Helidon
accumulates the time from all requests in the total duration.

Tracing, on the other hand, captures the usage of *multiple* parts of
your code as your service responds to a *single* request.

Metrics and tracing come together in Helidon’s support for exemplars.

In the context of metrics, an *exemplar* for a given meter is a specific
sample which, in some sense, made a typical contribution to the meter’s
value. For example, an exemplar for a `Counter` might be the most recent
sample which updated the counter. The metrics output identifies the
exemplar sample using the span and trace IDs of the span and trace which
triggered that sample.

Exemplar support in Helidon relies on the exemplar support provided by
the underlying metrics implementation. Currently, Helidon’s Micrometer
implementation supports exemplars as recorded by Micrometer’s Prometheus
meter registry and exposed by the OpenMetrics output (media type
`application/openmetrics-text`).

# Maven Coordinates

To enable OpenMetrics exemplar support, add the following dependency to
your project’s `pom.xml` (see [Managing Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.metrics</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-metrics-trace-exemplar</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

Also, include the Helidon integration module for a tracing
implementation (such as [Helidon Zipkin](../../mp/tracing.md#zipkin-tracing))

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.tracing.providers</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-tracing-providers-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Add the Helidon tracing component itself:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.tracing</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-tracing</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

Once you add the appropriate dependencies to your project, exemplar
support runs automatically as part of the Helidon metrics implementation
using Micrometer. You do not need to change your application or
configuration.

## Interpreting Exemplars

Each exemplar reflects a sample described by a label, a value, and a
timestamp. When a client accesses the `/metrics` endpoint and specifies
that it accepts the `application/openmetrics-text` media type, the
label, value, and timestamp appear in the OpenMetrics response for
meters that support exemplars.

The exemplar information in the output describes a single, actual sample
that is representative of the statistical value as recorded by the
underlying Micrometer Prometheus meter registry.

## Output Format

In the OpenMetrics output, an exemplar actually appears as a comment
appended to the normal OpenMetrics output.

OpenMetrics format with exemplars:
```text
meter-identifier meter-value # exemplar-label sample-timestamp
```

Even downstream consumers of OpenMetrics output that do not recognize
the exemplar format should continue to work correctly (as long as they
*do* recognize comments).

But some consumers, such as trace collectors and their UIs, understand
the exemplar format, and they allow you to browse meters and then
navigate directly to the trace for the meter’s exemplar.

# Examples

Once you enable exemplar support you can see the exemplars in the
metrics output.

Exemplar output - `Counter`
```text
# TYPE counterForPersonalizedGreetings counter
# HELP counterForPersonalizedGreetings
counterForPersonalizedGreetings_total{scope="application"} 4.0 # {span_id="6b1fc9f9fd42fb0c",trace_id="6b1fc9f9fd42fb0c"} 1.0 1696889651.779
```

The exemplar (the portion following the `#`) is a sample corresponding
to an update to the counter, showing the span and trace identifiers, the
amount by which the counter was updated (`1.0`), and the timestamp
recording when the update occurred expressed as seconds in the UNIX
epoch (`1696889651.779`).
