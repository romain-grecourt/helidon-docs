# Overview

The [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md)
defines a standard way to express the interface exposed by a REST
service.

The [MicroProfile OpenAPI spec](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-3.1.1/microprofile-openapi-spec-3.1.1.html)
explains how MicroProfile embraces OpenAPI, adding annotations,
configuration, and a service provider interface (SPI).

Helidon MP implements the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification.

The OpenAPI support in Helidon MP performs two main tasks:

- Build an in-memory model of the REST API your service implements.

- Expose the model in text format (YAML or JSON) via the `/openapi`
  endpoint.

To construct the model, Helidon gathers information about the service
API from whichever of these sources are present in the application:

- a static OpenAPI document file packaged as part of your service;

- a *model reader*

  The SPI defines an interface you can implement in your application for
  programmatically providing part or all of the model;

- OpenAPI annotations;

- a *filter* class

  The SPI defines an interface you can implement in your application
  which can mask parts of the model.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable MicroProfile OpenAPI, either add a dependency on the
[helidon-microprofile
bundle](../../mp/introduction/microprofile.md)
or add the following dependency to your project’s `pom.xml` (see
[Managing Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.microprofile.openapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-microprofile-openapi</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

If you do not use the `helidon-microprofile-bundle` also add the
following dependency which defines the MicroProfile OpenAPI annotations
so you can use them in your code:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile-openapi-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

## OpenAPI support in Helidon MP

You can very simply add support for OpenAPI to your Helidon MP
application. This document shows what changes you need to make to your
application and how to access the OpenAPI document for your application
at runtime.

## Changing your application

To use OpenAPI from your Helidon MP app, in addition to adding
dependencies as described above:

1.  Furnish OpenAPI information about your application’s endpoints.

2.  Update your application’s configuration (optional).

### Furnish OpenAPI information about your endpoints

Helidon MP OpenAPI combines information from all of the following
sources as it builds its in-memory model of your application’s API. It
constructs the OpenAPI document from this internal model. Your
application can use one or more of these techniques.

#### Annotations on the endpoints in your app

You can add MicroProfile OpenAPI annotations to the endpoints in your
source code. These annotations allow the Helidon MP OpenAPI runtime to
discover the endpoints and information about them via CDI at app
start-up.

Here is one of the endpoints, annotated for OpenAPI, from the example
mentioned earlier:

```java
@GET
@Operation(summary = "Returns a generic greeting", 
           description = "Greets the user generically")
@APIResponse(description = "Simple JSON containing the greeting", 
             content = @Content(mediaType = "application/json",
                                schema = @Schema(implementation = GreetingMessage.class)))
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public JsonObject getDefaultMessage() {
    return Json.createObjectBuilder()
            .add("message", "Hello World!")
            .build();
}
```

- `@Operation` gives information about this endpoint.

- `@APIResponse` describes the HTTP response and declares its media type
  and contents.

You can also define any request parameters the endpoint expects,
although this endpoint uses none.

This excerpt shows only a few annotations for illustration. The [Helidon
MP OpenAPI basic
example](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-examples/tree/helidon-4.x/examples/microprofile/openapi/basic)
illustrates more, and the [MicroProfile OpenAPI spec](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-3.1.1/microprofile-openapi-spec-3.1.1.html)
describes them all.

#### A static OpenAPI file

Add a static file at `META-INF/openapi.yml`, `META-INF/openapi.yaml`, or
`META-INF/openapi.json`. Tools such as Swagger let you describe your
app’s API and they then generate an OpenAPI document file which you can
include in your application so OpenAPI can use it.

#### A model reader class your application provides

Write a Java class that implements the OpenAPI
[`org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.OASModelReader`](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-3.1.1/apidocs/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASModelReader.html)
interface. Your model reader code programmatically adds elements to the
internal model that OpenAPI builds.

Then set the `mp.openapi.model.reader` configuration property to the
fully-qualified name of your model reader class.

#### A filter class your application provides

Write a Java class that implements the OpenAPI
[`org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.OASFilter`](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-3.1.1/apidocs/org/eclipse/microprofile/openapi/OASFilter.html)
interface. Helidon invokes your filter methods for each element of the
in-memory model, allowing your code to modify an element or completely
remove it from the model.

Then set the `mp.openapi.filter` configuration property to the
fully-qualified name of your filter class.

## Update your application configuration

Beyond the two config properties that denote the model reader and
filter, Helidon MP OpenAPI supports a number of other mandated settings.
These are described in the [configuration section](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-3.1.1/microprofile-openapi-spec-3.1.1.html#configuration)
of the MicroProfile OpenAPI spec.

## Accessing the REST Endpoint

Once you have added the MP OpenAPI dependency to your project, then your
application responds to the built-in endpoint, `/openapi`, and returns
the OpenAPI document describing the endpoints in your application.

Per the MicroProfile OpenAPI spec, the default format of the OpenAPI
document is YAML. There is not yet an adopted IANA YAML media type, but
a proposed one specifically for OpenAPI documents that has some support
is `application/vnd.oai.openapi`. That is what Helidon returns by
default.

In addition, a client can specify the HTTP header `Accept` as either
`application/vnd.oai.openapi+json` or `application/json` to request
JSON. Alternatively, the client can pass the query parameter `format` as
either `JSON` or `YAML` to receive `application/json` or
`application/vnd.oai.openapi` (YAML) output, respectively.

# API

The [MicroProfile OpenAPI specification](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-3.1.1/microprofile-openapi-spec-3.1.1.html)
gives a listing and brief examples of the annotations you can add to
your code to convey OpenAPI information.

The [MicroProfile OpenAPI Javadocs](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-3.1.1/apidocs)
give full details of the annotations and the other classes and
interfaces you can use in your code.

# Configuration

Helidon OpenAPI configuration supports the following settings:

Type:
[io.helidon.openapi.OpenApiFeature](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.openapi/io/helidon/openapi/OpenApiFeature.html)

This is a standalone configuration type, prefix from configuration root:
`openapi`

This type provides the following service implementations:

- `io.helidon.webserver.spi.ServerFeatureProvider`

Further, Helidon OpenAPI supports the MicroProfile OpenAPI settings
described in [the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-3.1.1/microprofile-openapi-spec-3.1.1.html#_configuration).

# Examples

Helidon MP includes a [complete OpenAPI example](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-examples/tree/helidon-4.x/examples/microprofile/openapi)
based on the MP quick-start sample app. The rest of this section shows,
step-by-step, how one might change the original QuickStart service to
adopt OpenAPI.

## Helidon MP OpenAPI Example

This example shows a simple greeting application, similar to the one
from the Helidon MP QuickStart, enhanced with OpenAPI support.

```java
@Path("/greeting")
@PUT
@Operation(summary = "Set the greeting prefix",
           description = "Permits the client to set the prefix part of the greeting (\"Hello\")") 
@RequestBody( 
              name = "greeting",
              description = "Conveys the new greeting prefix to use in building greetings",
              content = @Content(
                      mediaType = "application/json",
                      schema = @Schema(implementation = GreetingUpdateMessage.class),
                      examples = @ExampleObject(
                              name = "greeting",
                              summary = "Example greeting message to update",
                              value = "{\"greeting\": \"New greeting message\"}")))
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public Response updateGreeting(JsonObject jsonObject) {
    return Response.ok().build();
}
```

- With `@Operation` annotation we document the current method.

- With `@RequestBody` annotation we document the content produced.
  Internal annotations `@Content`, `@Schema` and `@ExampleObjects` are
  used to give more details about the returned data.

If we want to hide a specific path an `OASFilter` is used.

The OASFilter interface allows application developers to receive
callbacks for various key OpenAPI elements. The interface has a default
implementation for every method, which allows application developers to
only override the methods they care about. To use it, simply create an
implementation of this interface and register it using the
`mp.openapi.filter configuration` key, where the value is the fully
qualified name of the filter class.

The following example filter prevents information about a given path
from appearing in the OpenAPI document.

```java
public class SimpleAPIFilter implements OASFilter {

    @Override
    public PathItem filterPathItem(PathItem pathItem) {
        for (var methodOp : pathItem.getOperations().entrySet()) {
            if (SimpleAPIModelReader.DOOMED_OPERATION_ID
                    .equals(methodOp.getValue().getOperationId())) {
                return null;
            }
        }
        return OASFilter.super.filterPathItem(pathItem);
    }
}
```

You can implement a model reader to provide all or part of the in-memory
`OpenAPI` model programmatically. Helidon `OpenAPI` merges the model
from the model reader with models from the other sources (a static file
and annotations).

The example model reader below creates an `OpenAPI` object describing
two paths. It turns out that the filter described earlier will suppress
one of the paths, but the model reader does not know or care.

```java
/**
 * Defines two paths using the OpenAPI model reader mechanism, one that should
 * be suppressed by the filter class and one that should appear in the published
 * OpenAPI document.
 */
public class SimpleAPIModelReader implements OASModelReader {

    /**
     * Path for the example endpoint added by this model reader that should be visible.
     */
    public static final String MODEL_READER_PATH = "/test/newpath";

    /**
     * Path for an endpoint that the filter should hide.
     */
    public static final String DOOMED_PATH = "/test/doomed";

    /**
     * ID for an endpoint that the filter should hide.
     */
    public static final String DOOMED_OPERATION_ID = "doomedPath";

    /**
     * Summary text for the endpoint.
     */
    public static final String SUMMARY = "A sample test endpoint from ModelReader";

    @Override
    public OpenAPI buildModel() {
        /*
         * Add two path items, one of which we expect to be removed by
         * the filter and a very simple one that will appear in the
         * published OpenAPI document.
         */
        PathItem newPathItem = OASFactory.createPathItem()
                .GET(OASFactory.createOperation()
                             .operationId("newPath")
                             .summary(SUMMARY));
        PathItem doomedPathItem = OASFactory.createPathItem()
                .GET(OASFactory.createOperation()
                             .operationId(DOOMED_OPERATION_ID)
                             .summary("This should become invisible"));
        OpenAPI openAPI = OASFactory.createOpenAPI();
        Paths paths = OASFactory.createPaths()
                .addPathItem(MODEL_READER_PATH, newPathItem)
                .addPathItem(DOOMED_PATH, doomedPathItem);
        openAPI.paths(paths);

        return openAPI;
    }
}
```

Having written the filter and model reader classes, identify them by
adding configuration to `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` as the
following example shows.

```properties
mp.openapi.filter=io.helidon.microprofile.examples.openapi.internal.SimpleAPIFilter
mp.openapi.model.reader=io.helidon.microprofile.examples.openapi.internal.SimpleAPIModelReader
```

Now just build and run:

```shell
mvn package
java -jar target/helidon-examples-microprofile-openapi.jar
```

Try the endpoints:

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
{"message":"Hello World!"}

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/openapi
[lengthy OpenAPI document]
```

The output describes not only then endpoints from `GreetResource` but
also one contributed by the `SimpleAPIModelReader`.

Full example is available [in our official repository](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-examples/tree/helidon-4.x/examples/microprofile/openapi)

# Additional Information

## Building the Jandex index

A Jandex index stores information about the classes and methods in your
app and what annotations they have. It allows CDI to process annotations
faster during your application’s start-up, and OpenAPI uses the Jandex
index to discover details about the types in your resource method
signatures.

### Indexing your project

Add an invocation of the [Jandex maven
plug-in](https://github.com/smallrye/jandex/tree/main/maven-plugin) to
the `<build><plugins>` section of your `pom.xml` if it is not already
there:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
    <artifactId>jandex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
   <executions>
      <execution>
        <id>make-index</id>
      </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

When you build your app the plug-in generates the Jandex index
`META-INF/jandex.idx` and `maven` adds it to the application JAR.

### Indexing dependencies

Invoking the Jandex plug-in as described above indexes only the types in
your project. Some dependencies might include their own Jandex index
and, in that case, OpenAPI finds information about the types in the
dependency as well.

But if the signatures of your resource methods refer to types from
dependencies that do not have their own indexes then you should
customize how you use the plug-in.

The example below tailors the Jandex plug-in configuration to scan not
only the current project but another dependency and to index a specific
type from it.

```xml
<execution>
    <id>make-index</id>
    <configuration> 
        <fileSets>
            <fileSet>
                <dependency> 
                    <groupId>jakarta.ws.rs</groupId>
                    <artifactId>jakarta.ws.rs-api</artifactId>
                </dependency>
                <includes> 
                    <include>**/MediaType.class</include>
                </includes>
            </fileSet>
        </fileSets>
    </configuration>
</execution>
```

- Augments the default configuration.

- Adds a `fileSet` in the form of a `dependency` that is already
  declared in your project.

- Selects the type or types from the `fileSet` you want to include in
  the generated index.

You can add more than one dependency and scan for more than a single
type. See the [Helidon MP OpenAPI expanded Jandex example](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-examples/tree/helidon-4.x/examples/microprofile/openapi/expanded-jandex)
for more information and a complete project that indexes a dependency.

> [!NOTE]
> If your `pom.xml` *does not* create the Jandex index then the Helidon
> MP OpenAPI runtime automatically creates one in memory during app
> start-up. This slows down your app start-up and, depending on how CDI
> is configured, might inadvertently miss information.
>
> We *strongly recommend* using the Jandex plug-in to build the index
> into your app.
>
> Further, if your resource method signatures refer to types from
> outside your project we *strongly recommend* that you augment the
> Jandex plug-in invocation to include the dependencies and types your
> API uses. If you do not do so the resulting generated OpenAPI document
> is correct, but types that cannot be found are declared as `object` in
> the resulting OpenAPI model. This means your OpenAPI document contains
> less information about the types in your API than it otherwise could.
