# What’s New in This Release

- Introduction of the new Helidon WebServer (Project Níma): a virtual
  threads-based web server implementation based on [JDK Project
  Loom](https://openjdk.org/jeps/444) virtual threads.

- Removed Helidon’s Reactive WebServer and WebClient that were based on
  Netty. Our new implementations are based on virtual threads that have
  a blocking style API (Project Níma). Learn more: [Helidon 4
  WebServer.](#helidon_4_webserver)

- Converted other *reactive* API modules to *blocking* style APIs. The
  `io.helidon.common.reactive` APIs will stay as general purpose
  reactive utilities and operators. Learn more: [Helidon
  SE](#helidon_se)

- Upgraded MicroProfile support to MicroProfile 6 and Jakarta 10 Core
  Profile running on the Helidon WebServer. Learn more: [Helidon
  MP](#helidon_mp)

- Java 21 is required to use Helidon 4. Java 25 or newer is recommended.

# Helidon 4 WebServer

Before Helidon 4, the Helidon WebServer was built on Netty and had a
reactive API. In Helidon 4 we have replaced this with a new server
implementation (Project Níma) that is written from the ground up to take
full advantage of Java 21’s virtual threads. With virtual threads,
threads are no longer a scarce resource to be carefully pooled and
managed. Instead, they are an abundant resource that can be created as
needed to handle nearly unlimited concurrent requests.

Because each request runs in its own dedicated thread, it is free to
perform blocking operations, like calling a database, or another
service. And it can do so in a simple synchronous way with no fear of
blocking a platform thread and starving other requests. You no longer
need to resort to complicated asynchronous code to implement a
low-overhead, highly concurrent service.

# Helidon SE

Helidon SE is Helidon’s foundational set of APIs. The big change in
Helidon 4 is that the use of virtual threads have enabled these APIs to
change from asynchronous to blocking. This results in much simpler code
that is easier to write, maintain, debug and understand. Existing
Helidon 3 SE code will require modification to run on these new APIs,
but the effort is well worth the improved performance and simplicity of
the resulting code.

To give a very simple example of the differences between Helidon 3 SE
and Helidon 4 SE, let’s take a look at extracting a JSON body from an
HTTP request and doing something with it:

Helidon 3:
```java
request.content().as(JsonObject.class)
        .thenAccept(jo -> doSomething(jo, response));
```

Helidon 4:
```java
doSomething(request.content().as(JsonObject.class), response);
```

# Helidon MP

Helidon MP is Helidon’s MicroProfile implementation and in Helidon 4 it
supports MicroProfile 6 and the Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile. Your Helidon
3 MicroProfile application should migrate to Helidon 4 fairly easily
(the most significant changes are in MicroProfile Metrics 5.0), and
since Helidon’s MicroProfile server is based on the new Helidon
WebServer (Project Níma), you get all the benefits of running on virtual
threads.
