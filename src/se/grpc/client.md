# Overview

The Helidon gRPC client API is part of the WebClient API, but with
specific support to invoke remote procedures and to register handlers
for responses. All four types of gRPC calls are supported: unary,
bi-directional, client stream and server stream. A Helidon gRPC client
can be configured either using generated stubs (the most popular option)
or using manually crafted service descriptors.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable gRPC Client, add the following dependency to your project’s
`pom.xml` (see [Managing
Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-grpc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

## Generated Stubs

A Helidon gRPC client can be configured from generated protobuf stubs.
In what follows, we shall use the following proto file and the
corresponding stubs generated using the `protoc` command:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
option java_package = "my.package";

service StringService {
  rpc Upper (StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
  rpc Split (StringMessage) returns (stream StringMessage) {}
}

message StringMessage {
  string text = 1;
}
```

The gRPC protocol runs on top of HTTP/2, and as such requires TLS
configuration to establish a connection. Thus, the first step is to
configure TLS as shown next:

```java
Tls clientTls = Tls.builder()
        .trust(trust -> trust
                .keystore(store -> store
                        .passphrase("password")
                        .trustStore(true)
                        .keystore(Resource.create("client.p12"))))
        .build();
```

After creating a `Tls` instance, a `WebClient` can be created as
follows:

```java
WebClient webClient = WebClient.builder()
        .tls(clientTls)
        .baseUri("https://localhost:8080")
        .build();
```

So far, this is all the same as for accessing any protected REST
endpoint; the next step is to obtain a gRPC client stub using our newly
created client. This can be accomplished by *switching* the client
protocol to gRPC, and using its channel to create a stub:

```java
GrpcClient grpcClient = webClient.client(GrpcClient.PROTOCOL);
StringServiceGrpc.StringServiceBlockingStub service =
        StringServiceGrpc.newBlockingStub(grpcClient.channel());
```

Once a stub is created, it can be used to invoke any of its declared
methods, such as `upper` to uppercase a string:

```java
Strings.StringMessage msg1 = newMessage("hello");
Strings.StringMessage res1 = service.upper(msg1);
String uppercased = res1.getText();
```

When it comes to invoking a method that can return more than one value,
there are two options: it can block (we are using virtual theads after
all!) and return back an `Iterator` or you can provide a
`StreamObserver` as it is more commonly done when using gRPC. Let’s
consider the case of the `split` method that breaks up a sentence into
individual words, and can thus return multiple string messages.

Using an iterator as a result:

```java
Strings.StringMessage msg2 = newMessage("hello world");
Iterator<Strings.StringMessage> res2 = service.split(msg2);
while (res2.hasNext()) {
    // ...
}
```

Passing a stream observer and collecting all the messages into a
`Future` that returns an iterator:

```java
Strings.StringMessage msg3 = newMessage("hello world");
CompletableFuture<Iterator<Strings.StringMessage>> future = new CompletableFuture<>();
service.split(msg3, new StreamObserver<Strings.StringMessage>() {
    private final List<Strings.StringMessage> value = new ArrayList<>();

    @Override
    public void onNext(Strings.StringMessage value) {
        this.value.add(value);
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable t) {
        future.completeExceptionally(t);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCompleted() {
        future.complete(value.iterator());
    }
});
```

## Service Descriptors

Service descriptors are an alternative to using generated stubs and the
`protoc` compiler. A service descriptor provides service meta-data to
the WebClient for the purpose of carrying out invocations. The
descriptor includes, the service name, and a description of each service
method, including its type, what it accepts and what it returns.

The following is a descriptor for a service that includes the methods
called in the previous section using a stub:

```java
GrpcServiceDescriptor serviceDescriptor = GrpcServiceDescriptor.builder()
        .serviceName("StringService")
        .putMethod("Upper",
                   GrpcClientMethodDescriptor.unary("StringService", "Upper")
                           .requestType(Strings.StringMessage.class)
                           .responseType(Strings.StringMessage.class)
                           .build())
        .putMethod("Split",
                   GrpcClientMethodDescriptor.serverStreaming("StringService", "Split")
                           .requestType(Strings.StringMessage.class)
                           .responseType(Strings.StringMessage.class)
                           .build())
        .build();
```

Configuring a `WebClient` with `Tls` is done in the same manner as shown
above for the stub case. Once the gRPC client is created, a service
descriptor can be provided, and a method invoked using the methods
`unary`, `clientStream`, `serverStream` or `bidi`. For example,

```java
Strings.StringMessage res = grpcClient.serviceClient(serviceDescriptor)
        .unary("Upper", newMessage("hello"));
```

## Client URI Suppliers

A `ClientURISupplier` can be used to dynamically obtain a sequence of
`ClientUri` instances to access when executing a gRPC request. If a
client URI supplier is configured, the Helidon gRPC implementation will
attempt to connect to each endpoint one by one, in the order provided,
until a connection is successfully established. This feature is useful
in certain environments in which more than one identical server is
available, but with some potentially unavailable or unreachable.

A few common implementations are provided in `ClientUriSuppliers`. These
include suppliers for strategies such as random, round-robin, among
others. Applications can either use one of the built-in suppliers or
create their own.

The following example configures a round-robin supplier using a
collection of known servers:

```java
GrpcClient grpcClient = GrpcClient.builder()
        .tls(clientTls)
        .clientUriSupplier(RoundRobinSupplier.create(myServers()))
        .build();
```

If both a base URI and a client URI supplier are configured, the latter
will take precendence over the former.

## Client Interceptors

The gRPC API supports the notion of an interceptor on a channel.
Interceptors are useful to implement cross-cutting concerns that apply
to many or all invocations. These may include security, logging,
metrics, etc. They can be specified directly on the channel returned by
a `GrpcClient`, effectively *wrapping* that channel with a list of
interceptors to execute on every invocation.

```java
Channel newChannel = grpcClient.channel(myInterceptors());
```

# Metrics

Helidon supports a few metrics that are specific to gRPC clients and are
based on those defined in [gRPC OpenTelemetry
Metrics](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry-metrics/). Metrics
are disabled by default, but can be easily enabled as we shall discuss
shortly.

Here is the list of gRPC client metrics available in Helidon:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|----|----|----|----|
| grpc.client.attempt.started | Counter | grpc.method, grpc.target | The total number of calls started, including not completed ones, for a certain method and target. |
| grpc.client.attempt.duration | Timer | grpc.method, grpc.target, grpc.status | Timer that tracks call durations for a certain method and target. |
| grpc.client.attempt.sent_total_compressed_message_size | Distribution Summary | grpc.method, grpc.target, grpc.status | Summary of message sizes sent to clients for a certain method and target. |
| grpc.client.attempt.rcvd_total_compressed_message_size | Distribution Summary | grpc.method, grpc.target, grpc.status | Summary of message sizes received from clients for a certain method and target. |

The value of the label `grpc.method` is the fully-qualified method name;
the value of the label `grpc.target` is the base URI of the gRPC
service. At the time of writing, Helidon only tracks *successful* client
method calls, so the value of the `grpc.status` label is always set to
the string "OK". Support for metrics of unsuccessful calls may be added
in the future, hence the need to include the label at this time.

As stated above, gRPC client metrics are disabled by default but can be
enabled programmatically when building the client as shown next:

```java
GrpcClient grpcClient = GrpcClient.builder()
        .tls(clientTls)
        .baseUri("https://localhost:8080")
        .enableMetrics(true)        // enables metrics
        .build();
```

> [!NOTE]
> Metrics are only available for gRPC clients running in a server
> environment.

For more information see [Helidon
Metrics](../../se/metrics/metrics.md).

# Tracing

Tracing in the gRPC client is implemented as a so-called gRPC client
service. To enable tracing support, you need to list tracing as an
available service either programmatically or via config, and include the
following dependency in your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-grpc-tracing</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Tracing support is loaded via the gRPC client service SPI and made
available to clients. Using config, we can list it as an available gRPC
service as follows:

```yaml
grpc-client:
  grpc-services:
    tracing:
```

At the time of writing, no additional configuration is necessary under
the `tracing:` section. Finally, a gRPC client instance can be created
that is configured with tracing support enabled as follows:

```java
Config config = Config.create().get("grpc-client");
GrpcClient grpcClient = GrpcClient.builder()
        .config(config)     // with tracing
        .tls(clientTls)
        .baseUri("https://localhost:8080")
        .build();
```

# Configuration

TLS can be configured externally, just like it is done when using the
WebClient to access an HTTP endpoint. For more information, see
[Configuring the
WebClient](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/se/webclient#_configuring_the_webclient).

There are a few configuration options (see table below) that are
specific to a `GrpcClient` and can be configured using a
`GrpcClientProtocolConfig` instance. See
[RandomServiceTest](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-examples/blob/dev-4.x/examples/webserver/grpc-random/src/test/java/io/helidon/examples/webserver/grpc/random/RandomServiceTest.java)
for an example.
