Helidon SE is Helidon’s foundational set of APIs and, as of Helidon 4,
it uses virtual threads to enable these APIs to change from asynchronous
to blocking.

# Components

The REST framework for Helidon SE is the Helidon WebServer. It was built
from the ground up to take full advantage of Java 21’s virtual threads.

Helidon SE supports a number of additional Helidon features:
