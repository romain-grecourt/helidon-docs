# Overview

> [!NOTE]
> Micrometer integration is deprecated beginning in Helidon 4.1 and is
> planned for removal in a future major release. Please use the [Helidon
> neutral metrics
> API](../../se/metrics/metrics.md).

Helidon SE simplifies how you can use Micrometer for
application-specific metrics:

- The endpoint `/micrometer`: A configurable endpoint that exposes
  metrics according to which Micrometer meter registry responds to the
  HTTP request.

- The `MicrometerSupport` class: A convenience class for enrolling
  Micrometer meter registries your application creates explicitly or for
  selecting which built-in Micrometer meter registries to use.

- Configuration to tailor the Prometheus and other Micrometer meter
  registries.

In Helidon 4.4.0-SNAPSHOT, Micrometer support is separate from the
Helidon SE metrics API and the built-in Helidon metrics.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable {feature-name}, add the following dependency to your project’s
`pom.xml` (see [Managing Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-integrations-micrometer</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Micrometer supports different types of meter registries which have
different output styles and formats. Helidon provides built-in support
for the Prometheus meter registry. To use other meter registry types,
you will need to add dependencies for them to your `pom.xml` and,
optionally, add code to your application or add configuration to set
them up as you wish.

# Usage

Your application registers and updates Micrometer meters using
annotations or direct use of the Micrometer API.

Your users retrieve Micrometer meters using an endpoint which Helidon
creates automatically.

## Registering and Updating Meters

Your code can create, look up, and update metrics programmatically using
the Micrometer `MeterRegistry` API. The [Micrometer concepts document](https://docs.micrometer.io/micrometer/reference/concepts)
provides a good starting point for learning how to use Micrometer’s
interfaces and classes.

## Accessing the Helidon Micrometer Endpoint

Your application can easily have Helidon create a REST endpoint which
clients can access to retrieve Micrometer metrics, by default at the
`/micrometer` endpoint.

Within Helidon, each type of meter registry is paired with some code
that examines the incoming HTTP request to `/micrometer` and decides
whether the request matches up with the associated meter registry. The
first pairing that accepts the request returns the response. You will
need to take advantage of this if your application uses additional meter
registries beyond what Helidon automatically provides, *and* you want
those meter registries reflected in the output from the `/micrometer`
REST endpoint.

# API

## The Helidon Micrometer API

Helidon provides no special API for dealing with Micrometer meters and
meter registries beyond what Micrometer offers itself.

Helidon *does* give you an easy way to expose a REST endpoint to report
the meters stored in the Micrometer meter registry. The
[`MicrometerSupport`](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.micrometer/io/helidon/integrations/micrometer/MicrometerSupport.html)
interface exposes static methods to directly create an instance of
`MicrometerSupport` and to return a
[`Builder`](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.micrometer/io/helidon/integrations/micrometer/MicrometerSupport.Builder.html)
instance so your code can fine-tune how the REST service behaves.

# Configuration

You can configure the Helidon Micrometer REST service as you can other
built-in Helidon services by adding configuration settings under the
`micrometer` top-level key.

Type:
[io.helidon.integrations.micrometer.MicrometerFeature](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.integrations.micrometer/io/helidon/integrations/micrometer/MicrometerFeature.html)

Config key:
```text
micrometer
```

## Configuration options

| key                   | type                                                                   | default value | description                                                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cross-origin-config` | [CrossOriginConfig](../../config/io_helidon_cors_CrossOriginConfig.md) |               | Set the CORS config from the specified `CrossOriginConfig` object. |
| `web-context`         | string                                                                 |               | Set the root context for the REST API of the service.              |

Optional configuration options

By default, Helidon Micrometer integration exposes the `/micrometer`
endpoint. You can override the path using the
[`Builder`](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.micrometer/MicrometerSupport.Builder.html)
or the `micrometer.web-context` configuration key.

Overriding the default Micrometer path:
```yaml
micrometer:
  web-context: my-micrometer
```

# Examples

Helidon SE includes an [example application](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-examples/tree/helidon-4.x/examples/integrations/micrometer/se)
which uses Micrometer support.

The rest of this section takes you through the process of changing your
application to use Helidon SE integration with Micrometer:

1.  Register an instance of
    [`MicrometerSupport`](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.micrometer/io/helidon/integrations/micrometer/MicrometerSupport.html)
    with the web server.

2.  Create meters using the meter registry managed by Helidon’s
    `MicrometerSupport` and then update and query those meters.

## Register an Instance of MicrometerSupport with the Web Server

Initialize Micrometer support:
```java
static void routing(HttpRouting.Builder routing) {
    // Create the MicrometerFeature instance
    // It uses the default built-in Prometheus meter registry
    MicrometerFeature micrometerFeature = MicrometerFeature.create();
    HttpRouting.builder()
            // Exposed at `/micrometer` by default
            .addFeature(micrometerFeature)

            // Pass the registry to your service
            .register("/myapp", new MyService(micrometerFeature.registry()))
            .build();   
}
```

## Create and Update Meters in Your Application Service

Define and use a `Counter`
```java
class MyService implements HttpService {

    final Counter requestCounter;

    MyService(MeterRegistry registry) {
        // Use the Micrometer meter registry to create the request counter
        requestCounter = registry.counter("allRequests"); 
    }

    @Override
    public void routing(HttpRules rules) {
        rules
                .any(this::countRequests) 
                .get("/", this::myGet);
    }

    // A non-terminating handler that "filters" all requests
    // Increment the access counter for every request
    void countRequests(ServerRequest request, ServerResponse response) {
        requestCounter.increment(); 
        response.next();
    }

    void myGet(ServerRequest request, ServerResponse response) {
        response.send("OK");
    }
}
```

The example above enrolls the built-in Prometheus meter registry with
the default Prometheus registry configuration.

You can change the default setup for built-in registries, and you can enroll other meter
registries your application creates itself.

### Overriding Defaults for Built-in Meter Registry Types

Unless you specify otherwise, Helidon uses defaults for any built-in
Micrometer meter registry. For example, Helidon configures the built-in
Prometheus registry using `PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT`.

You can override these defaults in either of two ways:

- Using the [`MicrometerSupport.Builder`](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.micrometer/io/helidon/integrations/micrometer/MicrometerSupport.Builder.html) class
- Using configuration

### Using MicrometerSupport.Builder

Use the `MicrometerSupport.Builder` class to set up Micrometer support
however your application needs.

The builder lets you:

- Provide your own Micrometer meter registry configuration that
  `MicrometerSupport` uses to create a built-in meter registry, or

- Instantiate a Micrometer meter registry yourself, configured however
  you want, and add it to the `MicrometerSupport` object’s collection of
  meter registries

Overriding defaults for built-in meter registries using
`MicrometerSupport.Builder`:
```java
MeterRegistryFactory meterRegistryFactory = MeterRegistryFactory.builder()
        .enrollBuiltInRegistry(BuiltInRegistryType.PROMETHEUS, myPrometheusConfig) 
        .build();
MicrometerFeature micrometerFeature = MicrometerFeature.builder()
        .meterRegistryFactorySupplier(meterRegistryFactory)
        .build();
```

- Enroll the `PROMETHEUS` built-in registry type with your meter
  registry configuration.

### Using Configuration

To use configuration to control the selection and behavior of Helidon’s
built-in Micrometer meter registries, include in your configuration
(such as `application.yaml`) a `micrometer.builtin-registries` section.

Enroll Prometheus built-in meter registry using default configuration:
```yaml
micrometer:
  builtin-registries:
    - type: prometheus
```

Enroll Prometheus built-in meter registry with non-default configuration:
```yaml
micrometer:
  builtin-registries:
    - type: prometheus
      prefix: myPrefix
```

Note that the first config example is equivalent to the default Helidon
Micrometer behavior; Helidon by default supports the Prometheus meter
registry.

The configuration keys that are valid for the `builtin-registries` child
entries depend on the type of Micrometer meter registry. For example,
support in Helidon for the [Prometheus meter registry](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.micrometer/micrometer-registry-prometheus/1.11.1/io/micrometer/prometheus/PrometheusConfig.html)
respects the `prefix` configuration setting but other meter registries
might not and might support other settings. Refer to the documentation
for the meter registry you want to configure to find out what items
apply to that registry type.

Helidon does not validate the configuration keys you specify for meter
registries.

## Enrolling Other Micrometer Meter Registries

Creating and enrolling your own Micrometer meter registry:
```java
// This example uses a PrometheusMeterRegistry
// But it can be any extension of MeterRegistry
void snippet(PrometheusMeterRegistry registry) {
    MeterRegistryFactory registryFactory = MeterRegistryFactory.builder()
            // enroll the registry with a registry "handler" function
            // I.e., Function<ServerRequest, Optional<Handler>>
            .enrollRegistry(registry, request -> request
                    // E.g. return the prometheus metrics 
                    // when TEXT_PLAIN is an acceptable content-type
                    .headers()
                    .bestAccepted(MediaTypes.TEXT_PLAIN)
                    .map(mt -> (req, resp) -> resp.send(registry.scrape())))
            .build();
    MicrometerFeature micrometerFeature = MicrometerFeature.builder()
            .meterRegistryFactorySupplier(registryFactory)
            .build();
}
```

## Accessing the Helidon Micrometer Endpoint

Your application can easily have Helidon create a REST endpoint which
clients can access to retrieve Micrometer metrics, by default at the
`/micrometer` endpoint.

Within Helidon, each type of meter registry is paired with some code
that examines the incoming HTTP request to `/micrometer` and decides
whether the request matches up with the associated meter registry. The
first pairing that accepts the request returns the response. You will
need to take advantage of this if your application uses additional meter
registries beyond what Helidon automatically provides, *and* you want
those meter registries reflected in the output from the `/micrometer`
REST endpoint.

When `MicrometerSupport` receives a request at the endpoint, it looks
for the first enrolled meter registry for which the corresponding
`Function<ServerRequest, Optional<Handler>>` returns a non-empty
`Handler`. Helidon invokes that `Handler` which must retrieve the
metrics output from its meter registry and set and send the response.
Note that the `Handler` which your function returns typically has a
reference to the meter registry it will use in preparing the response.
