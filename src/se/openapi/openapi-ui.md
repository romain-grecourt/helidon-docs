# Overview

SmallRye offers an [OpenAPI user interface component](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-open-api/tree/3.3.4/ui/open-api-ui)
which displays a web page based on your application’s OpenAPI document.
Through that UI, users can invoke the operations declared in the
document.

> [!NOTE]
> The Helidon team discourages including the OpenAPI UI in production
> applications. The OpenAPI UI *can* be useful for demonstrating and
> testing your service’s endpoints prior to deployment.

The Helidon OpenAPI component allows you to integrate the SmallRye UI
into your application, adding the UI web page to your application very
simply.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable Helidon OpenAPI UI support, add the following dependency to
your project’s `pom.xml` (see [Managing Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.integrations.openapi-ui</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-integrations-openapi-ui</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

And add a runtime dependency on the SmallRye UI.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
    <artifactId>smallrye-open-api-ui</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

Also, make sure your project has the following dependency.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.openapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-openapi</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This dependency allows your application to create, configure, and
register the `OpenApiFeature` service.

# Usage

Make sure your application incorporates Helidon OpenAPI support as
described in detail in [the Helidon OpenAPI documentation](./openapi.md).
Helidon automatically prepares the OpenAPI UI with default settings if
you also declare a dependency on the Helidon OpenAPI UI integration
component as explained above. The [API](#api) section below illustrates
adding OpenAPI to your application and customizing the UI behavior.

After you modify, build, and start your Helidon SE service, you can
access the OpenAPI UI by default at
`http://your-host:your-port/openapi/ui`. Helidon also uses conventional
content negotiation at `http://your-host:your-port/openapi` returning
the UI to browsers (or any client that accepts HTML) and the OpenAPI
document otherwise.

You can customize the path using either the API or
[configuration](#configuration).

The example below shows the UI if you modify the Helidon SE QuickStart
greeting application to contain a static OpenAPI file which describes
the service endpoints.

<figcaption>Example OpenAPI UI screenshot</figcaption>
</figure>

With the OpenAPI UI displayed, follow these steps to access one of your
service’s operations.

1.  Find the operation you want to run and click on its row in the list.

2.  The UI expands the operation, showing any input parameters and the
    possible responses. Click the "Try it out" button in the operation’s
    row.

3.  The UI now allows you to type into the input parameter field(s) to
    the right of each parameter name. Enter any required parameter
    values (first highlighted rectangle) and any non-required values you
    wish, then click "Execute" (highlighted arrow).

4.  Just below the "Execute" button the UI shows several sections:  

    - the equivalent `curl` command for submitting the request with your
      inputs,

    - the URL used for the request, and

    - a new "Server response" section (second highlighted rectangle)
      containing several items from the response:  

      - HTTP status code

      - body

      - headers

The next image shows the screen after you submit the "Returns a
personalized greeting" operation.

Note that the UI shows the actual response from invoking the operation
in the "Server response" section. The "Responses" section farther below
describes the possible responses from the operation as declared in the
OpenAPI document for the application.

# API

With the Helidon OpenAPI UI dependency in your `pom.xml` file, the
OpenAPI support automatically includes the default UI behavior, possibly
modified by any UI settings you have in your configuration. You do not
have to do anything else to enable the UI.

## Creating `OpenApiFeature` with Automatic UI Behavior

Some applications explicitly create the `OpenApiFeature` object to
tailor its behavior before registering it with the server. If your
`pom.xml` includes a dependency on the OpenAPI UI component, then any
`OpenApiFeature` object your application builds prepares the default
OpenAPI UI behavior, possibly modified as above by any UI settings you
have in your configuration.

Create `OpenApiFeature` with automatic UI:
```java
WebServer server = WebServer.builder()
        .config(config.get("server"))
        .addFeature(OpenApiFeature.create(config.get("openapi"))) 
        .routing(Main::routing)
        .build()
        .start();
```

- Add the OpenAPI feature to the server, configured using the `openapi`
  section of the configuration.

If your code invokes the `OpenApiFeature.Builder` `config` method,
Helidon automatically applies the `ui` section of the `openapi`
configuration to the UI.

## Customizing the UI Behavior

You can control some of the behavior of the UI programmatically in two
steps:

1.  Create an
    [`OpenApiUiConfig.Builder`](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.integrations.openapi.ui/io/helidon/integrations/openapi/ui/OpenApiUiConfig.Builder.html)
    and invoke methods on it to set the UI behavior, then invoke the
    builder’s `build` method to create the `OpenApiUi` object.

2.  Invoke the `addService` method on
    [`OpenApiFeature.Builder`](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.openapi/io/helidon/openapi/OpenApiFeatureConfig.Builder.html),
    passing the `OpenApiUi` object you prepared above.

The following example illustrates these steps, combining configuration
with explicit programmatic settings.

Create `OpenApiUi` and `OpenAPISupport` instances:
```java
Config openApiConfig = config.get("openapi"); 
WebServer server = WebServer.builder()
        .config(config.get("server"))
        .addFeature(OpenApiFeature.builder() 
                            .addService(OpenApiUi.builder() 
                                                .webContext("my-ui") 
                                                .config(openApiConfig.get("ui")) 
                                                .build())
                            .config(openApiConfig)
                            .build())
        .routing(Main::routing)
        .build()
        .start();
```

- Extract the `openapi` config.

- Begin setting up the `OpenApiFeature` builder.

- Create the UI builder.

- Set UI behavior programmatically.

- Set additional UI behavior based on UI configuration.

The order in which your code invokes the methods on `OpenApiUi.Builder`
and `OpenApiFeature.Builder` determines the outcome. For instance, the
example above adds the UI service to the `OpenApiFeature.Builder`
*before* applying configuration to the `OpenApiFeature.Builder`. If the
configuration contains a setting for the UI `web-context` value, then
the UI uses the configured value and not the programmatic value because
your code applies the configuration later. Your code should typically
apply configuration *after* setting any values programmatically. Doing
so allows users or deployers of your service to set the behavior using
configuration according to their particular needs which your code might
not be able to anticipate.

> [!NOTE]
> The `webContext(String)` method on `OpenApiUi.Builder` sets the web
> context where the UI should respond instead of the default
> `/openapi/ui`. Helidon uses the provided string to set the *entire*
> web context for the UI, not as a suffix appended to the web context
> for the `OpenAPISupport` service.

# Configuration

To use configuration to control how the Helidon OpenAPI UI service
behaves, add an `openapi.services.ui` section to your configuration
file, such as `application.yaml`.

Type:
[io.helidon.integrations.openapi.ui.OpenApiUi](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.integrations.openapi.ui/io/helidon/integrations/openapi/ui/OpenApiUi.html)

## Configuration options

| key           | type                  | default value | description                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`     | boolean               | `true`        | Sets whether the service should be enabled. |
| `options`     | Map\<string, string\> |               | Merges implementation-specific UI options.  |
| `web-context` | string                |               | Full web context (not just the suffix).     |

Optional configuration options

The default UI `web-context` value is the web context for your
`OpenApiFeature` service with the added suffix `/ui`. If you use the
default web context for both `OpenApiFeature` and the UI, the UI
responds at `/openapi/ui`.

You can use configuration to affect the UI path in two ways:

- Configure the OpenAPI endpoint path (the `/openapi` part).

  Recall that you can [configure the Helidon OpenAPI component](./openapi.md#configuration)
  to change where it serves the OpenAPI document.

  Configuring the OpenAPI web context:
  ```yaml
  openapi:
    web-context: /my-openapi
  ```

  In this case, the path for the UI component is your customized OpenAPI
  path with `/ui` as a suffix. With the example above, the UI responds
  at `/my-openapi/ui` and Helidon uses standard content negotiation at
  `/my-openapi` to return either the OpenAPI document or the UI.

- Separately, configure the entire web context path for the UI
  independently of the web context for OpenAPI.

  Configuring the OpenAPI UI web context:
  ```yaml
  openapi:
    services:
      ui:
        web-context: /my-ui
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `openapi.services.ui.web-context` setting assigns the *entire*
  > web-context for the UI, not the suffix appended to the
  > `OpenApiFeature` endpoint.

  With this configuration, the UI responds at `/my-ui` regardless of the
  path for OpenAPI itself.

The SmallRye OpenAPI UI component accepts several options, but they are
of minimal use to application developers, and they must be passed to the
SmallRye UI code programmatically. Helidon allows you to specify these
values using configuration in the `openapi.services.ui.options` section.
Helidon then passes the corresponding options to SmallRye for you. To
configure any of these settings, use the enum values, they are all lower
case, declared in the SmallRye
[`Option.java`](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-open-api/tree/3.3.4/ui/open-api-ui/src/main/java/io/smallrye/openapi/ui/Option.java)
class as the keys in your Helidon configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> Helidon prepares several of the SmallRye options automatically based
> on other settings. Any options you configure override the values
> Helidon assigns, possibly interfering with the proper operation of the
> UI.
