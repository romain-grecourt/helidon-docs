# Overview

Helidon integrates with
[Tyrus](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.tyrus) to provide
support for the [Jakarta WebSocket API](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/jakarta-websocket-spec-2.1.html).
The WebSocket API enables Java applications to participate in WebSocket
interactions as both servers and clients. The server API supports two
flavors: annotated and programmatic endpoints.

Annotated endpoints, as suggested by their name, use Java annotations to
provide the necessary meta-data to define WebSocket handlers;
programmatic endpoints implement API interfaces and are annotation free.
Annotated endpoints tend to be more flexible since they allow different
method signatures depending on the application needs, whereas
programmatic endpoints must implement an interface and are, therefore,
bounded to its definition.

Helidon SE support is based on the `WebSocketRouting` class which
enables Helidon application to configure routing for both annotated and
programmatic WebSocket endpoints.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable WebSocket, add the following dependency to your project’s
`pom.xml` (see [Managing Dependencies](../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-websocket</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# Example

This section describes the implementation of a simple application that
uses a REST resource to push messages into a shared queue and a
programmatic WebSocket endpoint to download messages from the queue, one
at a time, over a connection. The example will show how REST and
WebSocket connections can be seamlessly combined into a Helidon
application.

The complete Helidon SE example is available
[here](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-examples/tree/helidon-4.x/examples/webserver/websocket).
Let us start by looking at `MessageQueueService`:

```java
record MessageQueueService(Queue<String> messageQueue) implements HttpService {
    @Override
    public void routing(HttpRules routingRules) {
        routingRules.post("/board", (req, res) -> {
            messageQueue.add(req.content().as(String.class));
            res.status(204).send();
        });
    }
}
```

This class exposes a REST resource where messages can be posted. Upon
receiving a message, it simply pushes it into a shared queue and returns
204 (No Content).

Messages pushed into the queue can be obtained by opening a WebSocket
connection served by `MessageBoardEndpoint`:

```java
record MessageBoardEndpoint(Queue<String> messageQueue) implements WsListener {
    @Override
    public void onMessage(WsSession session, String text, boolean last) {
        // Send all messages in the queue
        if (text.equals("send")) {
            while (!messageQueue.isEmpty()) {
                session.send(messageQueue.poll(), last);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is an example of a programmatic endpoint that extends `WsListener`.
The method `onMessage` will be invoked for every message. In this
example, when the special `send` message is received, it empties the
shared queue sending messages one at a time over the WebSocket
connection.

In Helidon SE, REST and WebSocket classes need to be manually registered
into the web server. This is accomplished via a `Routing` builder:

```java
void snippet() {
    var staticContent = StaticContentService.builder("/WEB")
            .welcomeFileName("index.html")
            .build();
    var messageQueue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<String>();
    server.routing(it -> it
                    .register("/web", staticContent)
                    .register("/rest", new MessageQueueService(messageQueue)))
            .addRouting(WsRouting.builder()
                    .endpoint("/websocket/board", new MessageBoardEndpoint(messageQueue)));
}
```

This code snippet registers `MessageBoardEndpoint` at `/websocket/board`
and associates.
