# Overview

Server-sent events (SSE) enable servers to push data to clients (e.g.
Web browsers) using standard HTTP or HTTPS through a unidirectional
server-to-client connection. In the server-sent events communication
model, the client establishes the initial connection, and the server
provides the data in the form of *event streams*. For more information
about server-sent events, see the [`Server-sent events`][sse-spec] specification.

SSE is an alternative technology to WebSockets when only
server-to-client messaging is required and can be accomplished without
the need to switch protocols (upgrades) and without using imperfect
solutions such as long polling. A server-sent connection is typically a
long-lived connection in which messages are sent to the client over a
longer period of time compared to a normal request-response connection.
It is useful for updating *live data* such as stock tickers, results of
live events, etc.

Helidon provides support for server and client APIs, although Web
browsers are popular client alternatives. The following sections
describe these APIs in more detail.

# Server API

The Server API is available as a loadable service in the Helidon
WebServer. The following additional dependency is required to find and
load the SSE service in the WebServer.

## Maven Coordinates

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-sse</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

Sending events is accomplished by obtaining an `SseSink` instance from a
`ServerResponse` using the `SseSink.TYPE` constant. The following
example converts the response into an `SseSink`, emits two string
messages and then closes the connection.

```java
void handle(ServerRequest req, ServerResponse res) {
    try (SseSink sseSink = res.sink(SseSink.TYPE)) {
        sseSink.emit(SseEvent.create("hello"))
                .emit(SseEvent.create("world"));
    }
}
```

Once an `SseSink` is obtained from a `ServerResponse`, the latter is no
longer usable to send additional data to the client given that response
`Content-Type` will be automatically set to `text/event-stream`. Note
that an `SseSink` is auto closeable, so it can be part of a
try-with-resources block as shown above.

Events can be created using any of the static `create` methods in
`SseEvent` as well as via a builder obtained by calling
`SseEvent.builder()`. For more information see the Javadocs for those
classes. In the example above, a simple create method with a string
param is used to showcase a very common use case. The API supports
integration with media type providers, so the event data may actually be
of any type as long as it is possible to convert it to a string value.

## Integration with Media Types

It is possible to serialize event data using the media support. For
example, if JSON-P is available in your class path, you can create an
SSE event from a `JsonObject` and Helidon will find the appropriate
media converter and serialize the event data on your behalf.

```java
void handle(ServerRequest req, ServerResponse res) {
    JsonObject json = Json.createObjectBuilder()
            .add("message", "Hello World")
            .build();
    try (SseSink sseSink = res.sink(SseSink.TYPE)) {
        sseSink.emit(SseEvent.create(json));
    }
}
```

Similarly, if JSON-B support is available in your class path, an event
can be created from an arbitrary Java class and serialized as shown
next:

```java
record Greeting(String message) {
}

void handle(ServerRequest req, ServerResponse res) {
    Greeting greeting = new Greeting("Hello World");
    try (SseSink sseSink = res.sink(SseSink.TYPE)) {
        sseSink.emit(SseEvent.create(greeting));
    }
}
```

An optional media type can be specified alongside the event’s data, in
case a different type of serialization is required or when multiple
media converters are available in the class path. For example, when
passing a Java instance, you may request XML instead of JSON
serialization by using `application/xml` as the event’s media type.

# Client API

The Client API is available as a loadable service in the Helidon
WebClient. The following additional dependency is required to find and
load the service in the WebClient.

## Maven Coordinates

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient-sse</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

Receiving events is accomplished by providing an `SseSource` handler
using the source type `SseSource.TYPE`. An `SseSource` is a functional
interface defined for the purpose of processing events. The following
example, obtains an `Http1ClientResponse` from a request and registers
an `SseSource` to process a single event.

```java
@Test
void test(Http1Client client) {
    try (var clientRes = client.get("/sseJson")
            .header(HeaderValues.ACCEPT_EVENT_STREAM)
            .request()) {
        var latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
        clientRes.source(SseSource.TYPE, event -> latch.countDown());
        assertThat(latch.await(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS), is(true));
    }
}
```

The `SseSource` type defines other methods such as `onOpen`, `onClose`
and `onError`.

The following example waits for zero or more string
events until the connection is closed. A `CountDownLatch` is a
convenient way to asynchronously wait until all the events are received.

```java
@Test
void test(Http1Client client) {
    try (var clientRes = client.get("/sseString")
            .header(HeaderValues.ACCEPT_EVENT_STREAM)
            .request()) {
        var latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
        clientRes.source(SseSource.TYPE, new SseSource() {
            @Override
            public void onEvent(SseEvent event) {
                latch.countDown();
            }

            @Override
            public void onClose() {
                latch.countDown();
            }
        });
        assertThat(latch.await(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS), is(true));
    }
}
```

## Integration with Media Types

The Client API is also integrated with media type support. The data
received as part of an event can be deserialized using any of the media
converters available in your class path. There are special methods in
`SseEvent` for this purpose. Without a parameter, the method `data()` in
`SseEvent` will always return a string. Other types can be requested
using `data(Class<T>)` and `data(Class<T>, MediaType)`. The latter is
necessary to select the correct media converter given that there is no
(standard) content type available as part of each event --but only a
single `text/event-stream` content type for the whole response.

For example, to convert an event into a Java instance using JSON-B, the
`application/json` media type is required as a second parameter --the
first parameter `Greeting.class` simply does not convey sufficient
information to select the appropriate converter for the event’s data in
this case.

```java
@Test
void test(Http1Client client) {
    try (Http1ClientResponse r = client.get("/sseJson")
            .header(HeaderValues.ACCEPT_EVENT_STREAM)
            .request()) {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
        r.source(SseSource.TYPE, event -> {
            Greeting greeting = event.data(Greeting.class, MediaTypes.APPLICATION_JSON);
            latch.countDown();
        });
    }
}
```
