# WebServer

To integrate [web server](../webserver/webserver.md), add the following
dependency to your project’s pom.xml file:

Maven Dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Configure Security with WebServer

There are two steps to configure security with WebServer:

1.  Create a security instance and register it with the server.
2.  Protect server routes with optional security features.

Example using builders:
```java
WebServer.builder()
        .addFeature(SecurityFeature.builder() 
                            .security(security)
                            .defaults(SecurityFeature.authenticate())
                            .build())
        .routing(r -> r
                .get("/service1", SecurityFeature.rolesAllowed("user"), this::processService1Request)) 
        .build();
```

- Register the security feature in the web server, enforce
  authentication by default

- Protect this route with authentication (from defaults) and role "user"

Example using configuration:
```java
WebServer.builder()
        // This is step 1 - register security instance with web server processing
        // security - instance of security either from config or from a builder
        // securityDefaults - default enforcement for each route that has a security definition
        .addFeature(SecurityFeature.create(builder -> builder.config(config))) 
        .routing(r -> r
                .get("/service1", this::processService1Request)) 
        .build();
```

- Helper method to load both security and web server security from
  configuration

- Security for this route is defined in the configuration

Example using configuration (YAML):
```yaml
security:
  web-server: 
      defaults:
        # defaults for paths configured in the section below
        authenticate: true
      paths:
        - path: "/service1/*"
          methods: ["get"]
          roles-allowed: ["user"]
          # "authenticate: true" is implicit, as it is configured in defaults above
```

- Configuration of integration with web server

Note: `defaults` section in configuration is related to paths on
WebServer configured below in `paths` section, it will not apply to any
other path on the webserver.

## Protecting Helidon endpoints

There are several endpoints provided by Helidon services, such as:

- Health endpoint (`/health`)

- Metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)

- OpenAPI endpoint (`/openapi`)

- Configured static content (can use any path configured)

These endpoints are all implemented using Helidon WebServer and as such
can be protected only through Security integration with WebServer.

The following section describes configuration of such protection using
configuration files, in this case using a `yaml` file, as it provides a
tree structure.

### Configuring endpoint protection

The configuration is usually placed under `security.web-server` (this
can be customized in Helidon SE).

The following shows an example we will explain in detail:
```yaml
security:
  providers:
    - abac: 
    - provider-key: 
  web-server:
    defaults:
      authenticate: true 
    paths:
      - path: "/metrics/*" 
        roles-allowed: "admin"
      - path: "/health/*" 
        roles-allowed: "monitor"
      - path: "/openapi/*" 
        abac:
          scopes: ["openapi"]
      - path: "/static/*" 
        roles-allowed: ["user", "monitor"]
```

- Attribute based access control provider that checks roles and scopes

- The provider(s) used in your application, such as `oidc`

- Default configuration for paths configured below in `paths` section

- Protection of `/metrics` and all nested paths with `admin` role
  required

- Protection of `/health` and all nested paths with `monitor` role
  required

- Protection of `/openapi` and all nested paths with `openapi` scope
  required

- Protection of static content configured on `/static` path with either
  `user` or `monitor` role required

If you need to use a properties file, such as
`microprofile-config.properties`, you can convert the file by using
index based numbers for arrays, such as:
```properties
security.providers.0.abac=
security.providers.1.provider-key.optional=false
security.web-server.defaults.authenticate=true
security.web-server.paths.0.path=/metrics/*
security.web-server.paths.0.roles-allowed=admin
security.web-server.paths.3.path=/static/*
security.web-server.paths.3.roles-allowed=user,monitor
```
