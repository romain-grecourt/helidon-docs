# Overview

Helidon Security provides authentication, authorization, and auditing
for your Helidon application. It includes the following features:

1.  Authentication - support for authenticating incoming requests,
    creating a security Subject with Principal and Grants. Principal
    represents current user/service. Grant may represent a Role, Scope
    etc. Responsibility to create Principals and Grants lies with
    AuthenticationProvider SPI. The following Principals are expected
    and supported by default:

    1.  UserPrincipal - the party is an end-user (e.g. a person) - there
        can be zero to one user principals in a subject

    2.  ServicePrincipal - the party is a service (e.g. a computer
        program) - there can be zero to one service principals in a
        subject

2.  Authorization - support for authorizing incoming requests.
    Out-of-the-box the security module supports ABAC and RBAC (Attribute
    based access control and Role based access control). RBAC is handled
    through RolesAllowed annotation (for integrations that support
    injection).

3.  Outbound security - support for propagating identity or (in general)
    securing outbound requests. Modification of a request to include
    outbound security is responsibility of OutboundSecurityProvider SPI

4.  Audit - security module audits most important events through its own
    API (e.g. Authentication events, Authorization events, outbound
    security events). A default AuditProvider is provided as well,
    logging to Java util logging (JUL) logger called "AUDIT" (may be
    overridden through configuration). AuditProvider SPI may be
    implemented to support other auditing options.

Each feature is implemented with the help of "[Security Providers](providers.md)".

Security module is quite HTTP centric (as most common use cases are
related to HTTP REST), though it is not HTTP specific (the security
module may be used to secure even other transports, such as JMS, Kafka
messages etc. if an appropriate integration module is developed, as all
APIs can be mapped to a non-HTTP protocol). Nevertheless, there may be
security providers that only make sense with HTTP (such as HTTP digest
authentication).

# Maven Coordinates

To enable Security, add the following dependency to your project’s
`pom.xml` (see [Managing Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

To integrate with a container, or to use Security standalone, we must
create an instance of security. In general, Security supports three
approaches

- a fluent-API builder pattern - you configure everything "by hand"

- a configuration based pattern - you configure everything in a
  configuration file

- hybrid - you load a builder from configuration and update it in a
  program

Once a security instance is built, it can be used to initialize an
[integration with a container](containers-integration.md), or to use
security from a program directly:

Security direct usage:
```java
SecurityContext context = security.contextBuilder(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
        .env(SecurityEnvironment.builder()
                     .method("get")
                     .path("/test")
                     .transport("http")
                     .header("Authorization", "Bearer abcdefgh")
                     .build())
        .build();

AuthenticationResponse response = context.atnClientBuilder().submit();
if (response.status().isSuccess()) {
    System.out.println(response.user());
    System.out.println(response.service());
} else {
    System.out.println("Authentication failed: " + response.description());
}
```

- Create a security context

- Use the context to authenticate a request

## Builder Pattern

Security through a builder:
```java
Security security = Security.builder()
        .addProvider(HttpBasicAuthProvider.builder())
        .build();
```

- Create a provider instance based on the provider documentation

## Configuration Pattern

See [Secure config](tools.md) for details about encrypting passwords in
configuration files.

Security from configuration:
```java
Security security = Security.create(config);
```

- Uses `io.helidon.Config`

As mentioned above, security features are implemented through providers,
which are configured under key `security.providers`. Each element of the
list is one security provider. The key of the provider must match its
config key (as documented in [Security Providers](providers.md) for
each supported provider).

A key `enabled` can be used for each provider to provide fine control of
which providers are enabled/disabled, for example to support different
setup in testing and in production environments.

Security from configuration - `application.yaml`:
```yaml
# Uses config encryption filter to encrypt passwords
security:
  providers:
  - abac:
  - http-basic-auth:
      realm: "helidon"
      users:
      - login: "jack"
        password: "${CLEAR=password}"
        roles: ["user", "admin"]
      - login: "jill"
        password: "${CLEAR=password}"
        roles: ["user"]
```

### Overriding Configuration

When a configuration needs to be overridden, we may have problems with
the list type of the `providers` configuration. To simplify overrides
using properties, you can explicitly set up a type of provider using a
`type` key.

Example:

```properties
security.providers.1.type=header-atn
security.providers.1.header-atn.authenticate=false
```

Would explicitly override the second provider (`http-basic-auth` in
example above) with `header-atn` provider. Note that the `type` and the
key of the provider must match.

## Hybrid Pattern (Builder with Configuration)

Security from configuration and builder:
```java
Security security1 = Security.builder(config)
        .addProvider(HttpBasicAuthProvider.builder())
        .build();

Security security2 = Security.builder()
        .addProvider(HttpBasicAuthProvider.builder())
        .config(config)
        .build();
```

- Uses io.helidon.Config
- Or reverse order
