Prerequisite product versions for Helidon 4.4.0-SNAPSHOT

Verify Prerequisites:
```shell
java -version
mvn --version
docker --version
kubectl version
```

Setting JAVA_HOME:
```shell
# On Mac
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21`

# On Linux
# Use the appropriate path to your JDK
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-21
```

# Introduction

This guide describes the steps required to protect your whole
application or a specific area with Open ID Connect (OIDC) security.
OIDC is a secure mechanism for an application to contact an identity
service. It’s built on top of OAuth 2.0 and provides full-fledged
authentication and authorization protocols.

# Keycloak Installation

## On Docker

To install Keycloak with Docker, open a terminal and make sure the port
8080 is free.

Enter the following command:
```shell
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin \
  -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
  quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:24.0.5 \
  start-dev
```

This will start Keycloak on local port 8080. It will create the admin
user with username `admin` and password `admin` Feel free to modify
24.0.5 by another keycloak version. If you are running docker behind a
proxy server, make sure it is either configured into docker or disabled.
Otherwise, you might face a connection timeout because docker cannot
download the required data.

To verify that Keycloak is running correctly, go to the admin console :
http://localhost:8080/admin.

Then login using the username and password mentioned above: `admin`.

You should be logged in successfully, and it prompts the admin console.

## On JDK

Download the last version of Keycloak from Keycloak website :
https://www.keycloak.org/downloads In the table Server choose
Standalone server distribution. ZIP or Tar format are available, click
on either to download Keycloak.

After extracting the archive file, you should have a directory named
keycloak followed by the version. For example, if you chose version
24.0.5, the folder must be named keycloak-24.0.5.

Open keycloak folder to make it your current directory.

Run this command from command prompt to open the directory:
```shell
cd keycloak-24.0.5
```

### Start Keycloak

To start keycloak and have it ready for further steps, run the following
command.

On Linux run:
```shell
bin/kc.sh start-dev
```

On Windows run:
```shell
bin\kc.bat start-dev
```

Keycloak runs on localhost:8080 by default.

## Create an Admin User

You need to create an admin user because it does not come by default
when installing Keycloak. To do this, open http://localhost:8080 in
your favorite browser.

A window `Create an administrative user` should be prompted. If not,
check if any error appear in the terminal.

Fill the form by adding Username and Password. Click on `Create user` to
create the admin user. A confirmation message is displayed and an
administrative user is created. Press `Open Administration Console` and
use the same credentials to log in.

After successfully logged in, the admin console is prompted.

# Setup Keycloak

To set up Keycloak properly, go to the admin console: http://localhost:8080/admin

If you are using Docker, use Username `admin` and password `admin` as it
is the default admin user. Otherwise, use the username and password you
used to create the admin user.

## Create a Realm

A realm is the place where groups of applications, and their
environment, can be created. It gathers :

- One or several applications
- One or several users
- Sessions
- Events
- Clients and their scopes

By default, there is a realm called `Master`. It is used to manage
Keycloak. It is not recommended to associate your application with this
realm as it could disturb Keycloak functioning.

To create a new realm to manage your application:

1.  Open Keycloak admin console http://localhost:8080/admin.

2.  Hover the mouse over the dropdown in the top-left corner where it
    says `Keycloack`, and press `Create realm`.

3.  Fill the form by adding the realm name, `myRealm` for example.

4.  Click on `Create` to create the new realm.

To verify that your realm is created, you should see your realm name (or
`myRealm` if you followed the example) in the top-left corner where it
said `Keycloack` previously.

To switch from a realm to another, hover the realm name, and the other
realm created appear in the dropdown. Click on any realm name to change
the current realm. Make sure all configuration or modification are saved
before changing the current realm or be subject to lose your
configuration.

## Create a User

Initially there are no users in a new realm. An unlimited number of user
can be created per realm. A realm contains resources such as client
which can be accessed by users.

To create a new user:

1.  Open the Keycloak admin console: http://localhost:8080/admin

2.  Click on `Users` in the left menu

3.  Press `Create new user`

4.  Fill the form (Username is the only mandatory field) with this value
    Username: `myUser`

5.  Click `Create`

A new user is just created, but it needs a password to be able to log
in. To initialize it, do this:

1.  Click on `Credentials` at the top of the page, next to `Details`.

2.  Press on `Set Password`.

3.  Fill `Password` and `Password confirmation` with the user password
    of your choice.

4.  If the `Temporary` field is set to `ON`, the user has to update
    password on next login. Click `ON` to make it `OFF` and prevent it.

5.  Press `Save`.

6.  A pop-up window is popping off. Click on `Set Password` to confirm
    the new password.

To verify that the new user is created correctly:

1.  Open the Keycloak account console: http://localhost:8080/realms/myRealm/account.
2.  Login with `myUser` and password chosen earlier
3.  Fill the form with required data

You should now be logged-in to the account console where users can
manage their accounts.

## Create a Client

To create your first client:

1. Open the Keycloak admin console: http://localhost:8080/admin.
2. Make sure the current realm is `myRealm` and not `Master`.
3. Navigate to the left menu, into configure section, click on
   `Clients`. This window displays a table with every client from the
   realm.
4. Click on `Create client`.
5. Fill the following:
   - `Client ID` : `myClientID`
   - `Client Protocol` : `OpenID Connect`
6. Press `Next`
7. `Capability config` step
   - Enable `Client authentication`
   - Enable `Authorization`
8. Press `Next`
   - Update `Valid Redirect URIs` : `http://localhost:7987/*`
9. Click on `Save`.

A new tab named `Credentials` is created. Click on it to access this new
tab.

- Select `Client Authenticator` : `Client ID and Secret`

- The client secret is displayed.

Keycloak is now configured and ready. Keep keycloak running on your
terminal and open a new tab to set up Helidon.

# Setup Helidon

Use the Helidon SE Maven archetype to create a simple project. It will
be used as an example to show how to set up Helidon. Replace
`4.4.0-SNAPSHOT` by the latest helidon version. It will download the
quickstart project into the current directory.

Run the Maven archetype:
```shell
mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-se \
    -DarchetypeVersion=4.4.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.examples \
    -DartifactId=helidon-quickstart-se \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.examples.quickstart.se
```

The project will be built and run from the helidon-quickstart-se
directory:
```shell
cd helidon-quickstart-se
```

## Update Project Dependencies

Update the pom.xml file and add the following Helidon dependency to the
`<dependencies>` section.

Add the following dependencies to `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.security.providers</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-security-providers-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Remove the `test` scope from `helidon-webclient` dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webclient</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webclient</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope> <!-- remove this line -->
</dependency>
```

## Add OIDC Security Properties

The OIDC security provider configuration can be joined to helidon
configuration file. This file is located here:
`src/main/resources/application.yaml`. It can be easily used to
configure the web server without modifying application code.

Add the following line to `application.yaml`:
```yaml
server:
  port: 7987
  host: localhost
  features:
    security:
        # protected paths on the web server
        paths:
          - path: "/greet"
            methods: ["get"]
            authenticate: true
security:
  providers:
  - abac:
      # Adds ABAC Provider - it does not require any configuration
  - oidc:
      client-id: "myClientID"
      client-secret: "changeit"
      identity-uri: "http://localhost:8080/realms/myRealm"
      audience: "account"
      header-use: "true"
      # proxy-host should be defined if you operate behind a proxy, can be removed otherwise
      proxy-host: ""
      frontend-uri: "http://localhost:7987"
      server-type: "oidc"
```

- `paths` section defines the protected application’s path.

- `client-id` must be the same as the one configure in keycloak.

- The client secret generate by Keycloak during `Create a client`
  section.

- `identity-uri` is used to redirect the user to keycloak.

- `frontend-uri` will direct you back to the application.

Make sure keycloak and the application are not running on the same port.
The application port value can be changed into application.yaml.

If the port 7987 is already used, check what port is free on your
machine.

Replace the old port into `application.yaml`:
```yaml
server:
  port: "{Your-new-port}"

frontend-uri: "http://localhost:{Your-new-port}"
```

## Configure Web Server

Once the properties are added, the web server must be setup. The
`Main#routing` method gather all configuration properties.

Add the following to the `Main#routing` method:
```java
Config config = Config.global();
routing.addFeature(OidcFeature.create(config));
```

- Create and register `OidcFeature`.

That code is extracting security properties from application.yaml into
two steps. First the Security instance is used to bootstrap security, so
the SecurityFeature instance can integrate security into Web Server.
Then, OidcFeature instance registers the endpoint to which OIDC
redirects browser after a successful login.

Helidon sample is now setup and ready.

# Build the Application

Build the application, skipping unit tests, then run it:
```shell
mvn package -DskipTests
java -jar target/helidon-quickstart-se.jar
```

The tests must be skipped, otherwise it produces test failure. As the
`/greet` endpoint for GET request is now protected, its access is
limited, and the tests are not built to take oidc security in account.

1. Open your favourite browser and try to access http://localhost:7987/greet/Michael
2. You should not be redirected and receive greeting from the application.
3. Enter the following into URL: http://localhost:7987/greet
4. Keycloak redirect you to its login page.
5. Enter the username and associated password:
    - `Username` : `myUser`
    - `Password`: `password`
6. After successful log in, keycloak redirect you to the
   http://localhost:7987/greet endpoint and print Hello word.
7. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the application.

From the actual settings, the user needs to log in only once, then
Keycloak saves all the connection data.

## Test Keycloak Process with Postman

Keycloak supports many authentication and authorization flows, but only
two of them will be shown. This section describes another way you can
get an access token or refresh a token or identity token. The identity
token contains information about the user. The access token contains
access information that the application can use to determine what
resources the user is allowed to access. Once expired, the refresh token
allows the application to obtain a new access token. As these tokens
contain sensitive information, they are valid for a very short period.
It is possible to make them last longer in order to let you manipulate
them with Postman. To do so:

1.  Open the Keycloak Console.
2.  Click on the `Realm Settings` in the left menu.
3.  Navigate to the `Tokens` tab.

You can increase the access token lifespan.

### Authorization Code Flow

The Authorization Code flow is suitable for browser-based applications.
It is composed of three main steps:

1.  The browser visits the application. The user is not logged in, so it
    redirects the browser to Keycloak which requires username and
    password for authentication.

2.  Keycloak authenticates the user and returns a temporary
    authorization code as a query parameter in the URL.

3.  The authorization code is used to get access and refresh token from
    Keycloak token endpoint.

For the first step, paste the following URL into your browser:
 http://localhost:8080/realms/myRealm/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=myClientID&response_type=code.

Two query parameters are provided, the client id and the response type.
Press enter and Keycloak responds with different URL containing a query
parameter `code`. You successfully received the authorization code.

In order to achieve the third step, we can use Postman to exchange the
authorization code for tokens. In Postman, select the Http POST method.
Keycloak endpoint to get token is the following: http://localhost:8080/realms/myRealm/protocol/openid-connect/token.

In the body of the request, select `x-www-form-urlencoded` type. Add the
following data:
```json
[
  {"key":"grant_type","value":"authorization_code"},
  {"key":"client_id","value":"myClientID"},
  {"key":"client_secret","value":"client secret"},
  {"key":"code","value":"authorization code"}
]
```

Do not forget to replace the `client secret` by its value (generated
during Create a Client), and `authorization code` by the code value in
the query parameter. Send the request by pressing `Send`. Keycloak
returns an access token and a refresh token.

### Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (Direct Access Grants)

The Direct Access Grants flow is used by REST clients that want to
request tokens on behalf of a user. To use Postman to make this request
on behalf of `myuser`, select the GET method and enter this URL:
`http://localhost:7987/greet/`. Under `Authorization` tab, select
authorization type\`OAuth 2.0\`. Under it, complete the sentence
`Add authorization data to` with `Request Headers`, and complete the
required fields.

Note: Make sure your Helidon application is running. If it is not,
please start it.

Enter the following information:
```json
[
  {"key":"Header Prefix","value":"bearer"},
  {"key":"Grant type","value":"Password  Credentials"},
  {"key":"Access Token URL","value":"http://localhost:8080/realms/myRealm/protocol/openid-connect/token"},
  {"key":"Client ID","value":"myClientID"},
  {"key":"Client Secret","value":"client secret"},
  {"key":"Username","value":"myuser"},
  {"key":"Password","value":"password"},
  {"key":"Scope","value":"openid"},
  {"key":"Client Authentication","value":"Send as Basic Auth Header"}
]
```

Again, make sure to replace `client secret` by the actual client secret.
Click on `Get New Access Token`. A popup window appears with
Authentication complete, click on proceed to display access, refresh and
identity token. Copy and paste the access token to `Access Token` field
and press `Send`. Helidon greeting application sends back
`Hello World !`.

### Update Tests to the Secure Environment

At this stage of the application, tests cannot pass because of OIDC
security. The only way to authenticate a user is through the front end
of that server which can be accessed with the browser for example.

In order to keep security and test the application locally, a new
security provider must be setup. By adding specific configuration to the
tests, it is possible to override the application configuration.

The following explains how to set a basic authentication instead of oidc
security provider only for the tests. Which means, at the end of this
guide, the application will be secured by oidc security provider, and
the tests will use basic authentication.

Add the following dependency to `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.security.providers</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-security-providers-http-auth</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

In the test folder open the application.yaml file:
`helidon-quickstart-se/src/test/resources/application.yaml`

Copy these properties into `application.yaml`:
```yaml
app:
  greeting: "Hello"

server:
  port: 7987
  host: localhost

security:
  providers:
    - abac:
      # Adds ABAC Provider - it does not require any configuration
    - http-basic-auth:
        users:
          - login: "jack"
            password: "jackIsGreat"
    - oidc:
        client-id: "myClientID"
        client-secret: "Your client secret"
        identity-uri: "http://localhost:8080/realms/myRealm"
        audience: "account"
        frontend-uri: "http://localhost:7987"
        server-type: "oidc"
  web-server:
    # protected paths on the web server - do not include paths served by Jersey, as those are protected directly
    paths:
      - path: "/greet"
        methods: ["get"]
        authenticate: true
```

- Replace this field by your Keycloak client ID.
- Replace this field by your Keycloak client Password.

Add the `http-basic-auth` properties in the security → providers
property section. This configuration will be used by the tests instead
of the `java/resources/application.yaml`.

In the `AbstractMainTest.java` file, tests need to be modified to check
the application security when accessing `/greet` path with a `GET`
method.

Replace the first webclient call by this one into testRootRoute method:
```java
try (HttpClientResponse response = client.get()
        .path("/greet")
        .request()) {
    assertThat(response.status(), is(Status.UNAUTHORIZED_401));
}
```

This piece of code uses the webclient to access the application on
`/greet` path with a `GET` method. The http basic authentication
security protects this path, so the client should receive an HTTP 401
code for unauthorized.

Only `jack` user has access to this part of the application.

Add new check to the testRootRoute method:
```java
String auth = "Basic " + Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString("jack:changeit".getBytes());
JsonObject jsonObject = client.get()
        .path("/greet")
        .header(HeaderNames.AUTHORIZATION, auth)
        .requestEntity(JsonObject.class);

assertThat(jsonObject.getString("message"), is("Hello World!"));
```

The username and password are encoded and placed inside the header in
order to authenticate as jack to access the application. If the
authentication is successful, the application send the `Hello World`
back as a `JsonObject`.

Now, the project can be built without skipping test.

Build the project:
```shell
mvn clean install
```

### Restrict Access to a Specific Role

To give less access to an endpoint, it is possible to configure user
role. So the application will only grant access to the user with the
required role.

Add a user and roles to the
`helidon-quickstart-se/src/test/resources/application.yaml`.

Add jack role and create a new user named john:
```yaml
- http-basic-auth:
    users:
      - login: "jack"
        password: "changeit"
        roles: [ "admin", "user" ]
      - login: "john"
        password: "changeit"
        roles: [ "user" ]
```

Into the `web-server` section, the `roles-allowed` parameter defines
which roles have access to the protected path and method.

Add `admin` role:
```yaml
web-server:
    # protected paths on the web server
    # do not include paths served by Jersey
    # as those are protected directly
    paths:
      - path: "/greet"
        methods: ["get"]
        roles-allowed: "admin"
        authenticate: true
```

Now, only Jack has access to secure endpoint as he has an admin role.
John, as a simple user, can not access it. Once it is done, go to the
tests to check the application behavior. The test from previous section
is still passing as jack has access.

The user `john` has only the `user` role so when accessing protected
endpoint, a 403 (Forbidden) http code is returned.

Check that john does not have access:
```java
String auth = "Basic " + Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString("john:changeit".getBytes());
try (HttpClientResponse response = client.get()
        .path("/greet")
        .header(HeaderNames.AUTHORIZATION, auth)
        .request()) {
    assertThat(response.status(), is(Status.FORBIDDEN_403));
}
```

Build the project:
```shell
mvn clean install
```

The tests pass, and your application is secured with specific roles in
addition to user IDs.
