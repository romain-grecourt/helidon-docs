In Helidon 3 we have made some changes to APIs and runtime behavior.
This guide will help you upgrade a Helidon SE 2.x application to 3.x.

# Java 17 Runtime

Java 11 is no longer supported in Helidon 3. Java 17 or newer is
required. Please follow the instructions in
[Prerequisites](../../about/prerequisites.md)
for proper installation.

# New Routing

Handling routes based on the protocol version is now possible by
registering specific routes on routing builder.

For further information check [WebServer Documentation](../webserver/webserver.md)

# Http/2 Support

Helidon support of Http/2 is no longer experimental.

Http/2 needed to be explicitly enabled by configuration in Helidon 2:

Enabling Http/2 support in Helidon 2:
```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  host: 0.0.0.0
  experimental:
    enable-http2: true
    http2-max-content-length: 16384
```

In Helidon 3 Http/2 is automatically enabled when artifact with Http/2
support is available on the classpath.

Enabling Http/2 support in Helidon 3 by adding dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-http2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

With above dependency Helidon 3 supports Http/2 upgrade from Http/1,
cleartext Http/2 without prior knowledge and Http/2 with ALPN over TLS.

In Helidon 2, max content length was configurable with
`server.experimental.http2-max-content-length`, in Helidon 3 can be
configured with `server.max-upgrade-content-length` globally or per
socket with the same `max-upgrade-content-length` key.

Max upgrade content length in Helidon 3:
```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  host: 0.0.0.0
  max-upgrade-content-length: 16384
```

For further information check [WebServer Documentation](../webserver/webserver.md)

# WebSocket

Helidon SE support is now based on the `WebSocketRouting` class which
enables Helidon application to configure routing for both annotated and
programmatic WebSocket endpoints. `TyrusSupport` is now deprecated.
Websocket support in now placed in different artifact.

Helidon 2 WebSocket support dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-tyrus</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Helidon 3 WebSocket support dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-websocket</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

In Helidon 2, WebSocket routing is defined by registering `TyrusSupport`
as additional service:
```java
void snippet()() {
    WebServer.builder(Routing.builder()
                // Traditional REST routing service registration
                .register("/rest", new SomeRestService())
            
                // WebSocket setup with Tyrus service
                .register("/websocket", TyrusSupport.builder()
                        .register(ServerEndpointConfig.Builder
                                .create(MessageBoardEndpoint.class, "/")
                                .encoders(encoders)
                                .build())
                        .build()))
            .port(8080)
            .build();
}
```

In Helidon 3, WebSocket routing is defined by adding another routing:
```java
void snippet()() {
    WebServer.builder()
            // Traditional REST routing service registration
            .routing(r -> r.register("/rest", new SomeRestService()))
            
            // New WebSocket routing setup
            .addRouting(WebSocketRouting.builder()
                    .endpoint("/websocket", ServerEndpointConfig.Builder
                            .create(MessageBoardEndpoint.class, "/board")
                            .encoders(encoders)
                            .build())
                    .build())
            .port(8080)
            .build();
}
```

# Deprecations

- The custom Helidon OCI clients have been deprecated ([See PR](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/4015)).

Use the OCI Java SDK instead. If you use Helidon MP you can inject OCI
SDK clients by adding the dependency
`io.helidon.integrations.oci.sdk:helidon-integrations-oci-sdk-cdi`.

- The MultiPart buffered readers have been deprecated ([See PR](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/4096)). Use the MultiPart
  stream readers instead.
