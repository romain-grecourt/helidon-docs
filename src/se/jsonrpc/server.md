# Overview

The Helidon WebServer provides a framework for creating [JSON-RPC
2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) applications. The JSON-RPC
protocol is a stateless and lightweight protocol based on JSON that runs
on top of HTTP/1.1. It offers the ability to invoke remote methods
passing parameters and getting results as JSON values.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable WebServer/JSON-RPC, add the following dependency to your
project’s `pom.xml` (see [Managing
Dependencies](../../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.webserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-webserver-jsonrpc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

## Service Implementation

JSON-RPC routing is multi-leveled: first-level routing is similar to
HTTP using path expressions, and second-level routing is based on method
names in JSON payloads. After routing, a JSON-RPC method handler is
invoked and given access to any parameters with the option of responding
either with a result or an error.

Setting the Helidon WebServer to accept JSON-RPC requests starts by
building a `JsonRpcRouting` instance that includes individual method
routes or a group of routes aggregated by a *service*.

```java
JsonRpcRouting jsonRpcRouting = JsonRpcRouting.builder()
        .service(new MachineService())
        .build();

WebServer.builder()
        .port(8080)
        .host("localhost")
        .routing(r -> r.register("/rpc", jsonRpcRouting))
        .build()
        .start();
```

In the example above, the `JsonRpcRouting` instance is created from a
single JSON-RPC service `MachineService` and registered in the WebServer
under the `/rpc` path. The `MachineService` class must extend
`JsonRpcService` and override the `routing(JsonRpcRules)` method to add
mappings for each of the JSON-RPC method names supported by the
application. This is very similar to the way an `HttpService` is defined
except for the multi-leveled mapping that includes paths and JSON-RPC
method names as shown next.

```java
class MachineService implements JsonRpcService {

    @Override
    public void routing(JsonRpcRules rules) {
        rules.register("/machine",
                       JsonRpcHandlers.builder()
                               .method("start", this::start)
                               .method("stop", this::stop)
                               .build());
    }

    void start(JsonRpcRequest req, JsonRpcResponse res) {
        StartStopParams params = req.params().as(StartStopParams.class);
        if (params.when().equals("NOW")) {
            res.result(new StartStopResult("RUNNING"));
        } else {
            res.error(JsonRpcError.INVALID_PARAMS, "Bad param");
        }
        res.send();
    }

    void stop(JsonRpcRequest req, JsonRpcResponse res) {
        StartStopParams params = req.params().as(StartStopParams.class);
        if (params.when().equals("NOW")) {
            res.result(new StartStopResult("STOPPED"));
        } else {
            res.error(JsonRpcError.INVALID_PARAMS, "Bad param");
        }
        res.send();
    }
}
```

This JSON-RPC service registers handlers for method names `start` and
`stop` under the path `/machine`, thus JSON-RPC clients shall use the
`/rpc/machine` URI to send requests, see `JsonRpcRouting` instance
creation above.

The logic for the two methods `start` and `stop` is very similar. First,
they inspect parameters, then they decide to return either a result or
an error, and finally they call `send()` on the response. Parameters, as
well as results, can be either JSON-P instances or JSON-B objects. In
this example, we defined some simple records to bind and serialize data
using JSON-B.

```java
public record StartStopParams(String when, Duration duration) {
}

public record StartStopResult(String status) {
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> These record types used during serialization must be public for the
> JSON-B implementation (Eclipse Yasson in our example) to have access
> to them.

# Configuration

At the time of writing, there is no configuration that is specific to
the JSON-RPC feature other than what is already provided by the
WebServer itself.
