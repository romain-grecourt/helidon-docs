# Overview

Helidon provides built-in test support for Helidon testing with JUnit 5.

# Maven Coordinates

To enable Helidon Testing Framework, add the following dependency to
your project’s `pom.xml` (see [Managing Dependencies](../about/managing-dependencies.md)).

```xml
<dependency>
     <groupId>io.helidon.webserver.testing.junit5</groupId>
     <artifactId>helidon-webserver-testing-junit5</artifactId>
     <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

Helidon provides a rich set of extensions based on JUnit 5 for Helidon
WebServer testing. Testing can be done with automatic server start-up,
configuration, and shutdown. Testing can also be done without full
server start-up with `DirectClient` when no real sockets are created.

# API

There are two main annotations that you can use to test Helidon
WebServer.

- `@ServerTest` is an integration test annotation that starts the server
  (opens ports) and provides client injection pre-configured for the
  server port(s).

- `@RoutingTest` is a unit test annotation that does not start the
  server and does not open ports but provides a direct client (with the
  same API as the usual network client) to test routing.

The additional annotation `@Socket` can be used to qualify the injection
of parameters into test constructors or methods, such as to obtain a
client configured for the named socket.

The following table lists the supported types of parameters for the
`@SetUpRoute` annotated methods. Such methods MUST be static and may
have any name. The `@SetUpRoute` annotation has `value` with socket name
(to customize the setup for a different socket).

- Parameter type - supported class of a parameter

- Annotation - which annotations support this parameter

- Modules - which webserver extension modules support this signature

| Parameter Type             | Annotation                    | Modules   | Notes                                             |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `HttpRouting.Builder`      | `@ServerTest`, `@RoutingTest` |           |                                                   |
| `HttpRules`                | `@ServerTest`, `@RoutingTest` |           | Same as `HttpRouting.Builder`, only routing setup |
| `Router.RouterBuilder<?>`  | `@ServerTest`, `@RoutingTest` |           |                                                   |
| `SocketListener.Builder`   | `@ServerTest`                 |           |                                                   |
| `WebSocketRouting.Builder` | `@ServerTest`, `@RoutingTest` | websocket |                                                   |

Parameters for the `@SetUpRoute` annotated methods.

In addition:

- a static method annotated with `@SetUpServer` can be defined for
  tests, which has a single parameter of
  [`WebServerConfig.Builder`](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/apidocs/io.helidon.webserver/io/helidon/webserver/WebServerConfig.Builder.html).

- a static method annotated with `@SetUpFeatures` can be defined for
  tests, which returns `List<? extends ServerFeature>` to configure
  additional features, or update discovered features, feature discovery
  can be disabled using the annotation `` value()` ``

The following table lists the injectable types (through constructor or
method injection).

- Type - type that can be injected
- Socket - if checked, you can use the `@Socket` annotation to obtain a
  value specific to that named socket
- Annotation - which annotations support this injection
- Modules - which WebServer extension modules support this injection
- Notes - additional details

Injectable types.

Extensions can enhance the features for the module
`helidon-testing-junit5-webserver` to support additional protocols.

# Examples

You can create the following test to validate that the server returns
the correct response:

Basic Helidon test framework usage:
```java
@ServerTest
class MyServerTest {

    final Http1Client client;

    MyServerTest(Http1Client client) {
        this.client = client;
    }

    @SetUpRoute
    static void routing(HttpRouting.Builder builder) {
        Main.routing(builder);
    }

    @Test
    void testRootRoute() {
        try (Http1ClientResponse response = client
                .get("/greet")
                .request()) {
            assertThat(response.status(), is(Status.OK_200));
        }
    }
}
```

- Use `@ServerTest` to trigger the testing framework.
- Inject `Http1Client` for the test.
- SetUp routing for the test.
- Regular `JUnit` test method.
- Call the `client` to obtain server response
- Perform the necessary assertions.

To trigger the framework to start and configure the server, annotate the
testing class with the `@ServerTest` annotation.

In this test, the `Http1Client` client is used, which means that the
framework will create, configure, and inject this object as a parameter
to the constructor.

To set up routing, a static method annotated with `@SetUpRoute` is
present. The framework uses this method to inject the configured routing
to the subject of testing – in the current case, the `Quickstart`
application.

As everything above is performed by the testing framework, regular unit
tests can be done. After completing all tests, the testing framework
will shut down the server.

## Routing Tests

If there is no need to set up and run a server, a `DirectClient` client
can be used. It is a testing client that bypasses HTTP transport and
directly invokes the router.

Routing test using `@RoutingTest` and `DirectClient`:
```java
@RoutingTest
class MyRoutingTest {

    final Http1Client client;

    MyRoutingTest(DirectClient client) {
        this.client = client;
    }

    @SetUpRoute
    static void routing(HttpRouting.Builder builder) {
        Main.routing(builder);
    }

    @Test
    void testRootRoute() {
        try (Http1ClientResponse response = client
                .get("/greet")
                .request()) {
            JsonObject json = response.as(JsonObject.class);
            assertThat(json.getString("message"), is("Hello World!"));
        }
    }
}
```

- Use `@RoutingTest` to trigger the testing framework.
- Inject `DirectClient` for the test.
- SetUp routing for the test.
- A regular `JUnit` test method.
- Call the `client` to obtain server response.
- Perform the necessary assertions.

If only routing tests are required, this is a "lighter" way of testing
because the framework will not configure and run the full Helidon
server. This way, no real ports will be opened. All the communication
will be done through `DirectClient`, which makes the tests very
effective.

It is required to annotate the test class with the `@RoutingTest`
annotation to trigger the server to do the configuration. Thus, it will
inject the DirectClient client, which can then be used in unit tests.

Routing is configured the same way as in full server testing using the
`@SetUpRoute` annotation.

# Virtual Threads

Helidon tests are able to detect Virtual Threads pinning. A situation
when carrier thread is blocked in a way, that virtual thread scheduler
can’t use it for scheduling of other virtual threads. This can happen
for example when blocking native code is invoked, or prior to the JDK 24
when blocking IO operation happens in a synchronized block. Pinning can
in some cases negatively affect application performance.

Enable pinning detection:
```java
@ServerTest(pinningDetection = true)
class MyTest {
}
```

Pinning is considered as harmful when it takes longer than 20
milliseconds, that is also the default when detecting it within Helidon
tests.

Pinning threshold can be changed with:
```java
// Change pinning threshold from default(20) to 50 milliseconds
@ServerTest(pinningDetection = true, pinningThreshold = 50)
class MyTest {
}
```

When pinning is detected, test fails with stacktrace pointing to the
line of code causing it.

# Additional Information

## WebSocket Testing

If WebSocket testing is required, there is an additional module for it.
It is necessary to include the following Maven dependency to the
Project’s pom file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.helidon.testing.junit5</groupId>
    <artifactId>helidon-testing-junit5-websocket</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

## WebSocket Testing Example

The WebSocket Testing extension adds support for routing configuration
and injection of WebSocket related artifacts, such as WebSockets and
DirectWsClient in Helidon unit tests.

WebSocket sample test:

```java
@ServerTest
class WsSocketTest {

    static final ServerSideListener WS_LISTENER = new ServerSideListener();
    final WsClient wsClient;

    WsSocketTest(WsClient wsClient) {
        this.wsClient = wsClient;
    }

    @SetUpRoute
    static void routing(WsRouting.Builder ws) {
        ws.endpoint("/testWs", WS_LISTENER);
    }

    @Test
    void testWsEndpoint() {
        ClientSideListener clientListener = new ClientSideListener();
        wsClient.connect("/testWs", clientListener);
        assertThat(clientListener.message, is("ws"));
    }
}
```

- Declare `WsClient` and later inject it in the constructor.
- Using @SetUpRoute, create WebSocket routing and assign a serverside
  listener.
- Test the WebSocket endpoint using the regular @Test annotation.
- Create and assign the clientside listener.
- Check if the received message is correct.

`ClientSideListener` helper class:
```java
static class ClientSideListener implements WsListener {
    volatile String message;
    volatile Throwable error;

    @Override
    public void onOpen(WsSession session) {
        session.send("hello", true);
    }

    @Override
    public void onMessage(WsSession session, String text, boolean last) {
        message = text;
        session.close(WsCloseCodes.NORMAL_CLOSE, "End");
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(WsSession session, Throwable t) {
        error = t;
    }
}
```

- Send "Hello" when a connection is opened.
- Save the message when received and close the connection.
- React on an error.

The WebSocket `ClientSideListener` is also a helper class that
implements `WsListener` and is very straightforward:

`ServerSideListener` helper class:
```java
static class ServerSideListener implements WsListener {
    volatile String message;

    @Override
    public void onMessage(WsSession session, String text, boolean last) {
        message = text;
        session.send("ws", true);
    }
}
```
- Send "ws" on a received message.

The testing class should be annotated with `@RoutingTest` only if
routing tests are required without real port opening. Instead of
`WsClient`, use `DirectWsClient`.
